            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In order to this, we have two great Deſigns to attempt the next Seſſions: 1. to put the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon making their humble requeſt to the King, that the Fleet may be put into his Royal Highneſs's Care. And, 2. To get an Act for general Liberty of Conſcience: If we carry either of them, we ſhall in effect do what we liſt afterwards. Our prevailing in theſe things, will give the greateſt Blow to the Proteſtant Religion here, that ever it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſince its Birth.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Letters and Writings here publiſh'd are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably <hi>authentick.</hi> They were all (except thoſe of which account is given at the end) found and ſeized in Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Houſe at the time of his Commitment, and owned by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and particularly at his <hi>Tryal;</hi> when ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Letters written by and to him were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and read, and then mark'd by the Clerk of the Crown with <hi>Lect. pro Rege,</hi> as is here printed in the Margins. And they were by his Majeſties Order delivered to the Houſes of Parliament, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Committee of Secrecy.</p>
            <p>Alſo the hand-writing of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leyburne,</hi> Sir <hi>William Throgmorton,</hi> and the late Earle of <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> by the name of <hi>William Rice,</hi> have been proved by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſuch Witneſſes as well knew the ſame.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Letters</hi> writ <hi>by</hi> Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> are printed from the <hi>Original</hi> draughts, written by him in <hi>French,</hi> and tranſlated by Order of the Privy Council; and ſuch of the <hi>Letters</hi> ſent <hi>to</hi> Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> which were written in <hi>French,</hi> were tranſlated either by the ſame Order, or by Order of one of the Houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Letters writ <hi>by</hi> Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> were <hi>read</hi> in the Houſe of Commons in this and the two laſt Parliaments, and the reſt either <hi>read,</hi> or in ſubſtance <hi>reported</hi> in this and the laſt Parliament, by their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In most of theſe Letters the principal and material words and names of Perſons and Places were writ in <hi>Cypher,</hi> but have been exactly decypher'd by the <hi>Keys</hi> or <hi>Tables</hi> which were found together with them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:153668:4"/>
            <p>In ſeveral of them there were uſed <hi>Figurative</hi> words, or words of <hi>Cabal;</hi> the meaning of which, is conjectured from the Tenor and Sence of the Correſpondence, as (in the <hi>Allegories</hi> uſed between Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and the <hi>Nuntio</hi>) the word <hi>Creditors</hi> appears to ſignifie Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>Debtors,</hi> Friends, <hi>Eaſt-India Company,</hi> the Paliament; and <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Traffique,</hi> the adminiſtration of publick Affairs. So <hi>Suit,</hi> appears to ſignifie conteſting (eſpecially in Parliament) concerning the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt; definitive Sentence,</hi> gaining the point in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. And in the like <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Sence, are uſed <hi>Proceſs, Lawyers, Advocates,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Correſpondents in theſe Letters, do ſeldom uſe the <hi>Firſt</hi> Perſon, when they mention themſelves; or the <hi>Second</hi> Perſon, when they mean him to whom it is written, but they uſe the <hi>Cypher</hi> of their Names for the Perſons. And accordingly they are decypher'd and render'd in the <hi>Third</hi> Perſon. As in the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Letters to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> it is written that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> did <hi>ſo,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſhould do <hi>thus, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> intended and directed Exactneſs of Truth in this <hi>Publication.</hi> In obſervance of which not only Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s but the Letters of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and others, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeveral paſſages not directly relating to the <hi>main</hi> Deſign, are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd <hi>at large,</hi> ſo as they ſtand repreſented to the World without any other diſadvantage than what is inherent in <hi>themſelves.</hi> But ſeveral Letters of Mr. <hi>Leyburn,</hi> and ſome of the Letters of others of the leſſer Correſpondents, being ſtuft with common and ordinary News, that News, and <hi>that</hi> only is omitted in this Print.</p>
            <p>Some of the Letters ſeized at Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s are not decypherable by all or any of the <hi>Keys</hi> found, of which, however <hi>one</hi> is thought fit to be publiſht, which is inſerted towards the end.</p>

                  <p>I AM commanded to tell you, That his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lect. pro Rege.</note> my <hi>Maſter,</hi> is very ſenſible of the Friendſhip of his <hi>moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Majeſty,</hi> which he will endeavour to cultivate very <hi>carefully,</hi> and to give him all poſſible <hi>Aſſurances</hi> of it, to take away all <hi>Jealouſies</hi> that his Enemies would raiſe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>That his Royal Highneſs has done nothing in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, nor in any place, againſt the Intereſt of his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> but hath rendred him all the <hi>good Offices</hi> he hath been capable of.</p>
                  <p>That as for recalling the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and touching my Lord <hi>A—</hi> his Highneſs is altogether of the opinion of his Majeſty, that neither one nor other is uſeful, but quite contrary, very dangerous as well for <hi>England</hi> as <hi>France,</hi> and that his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> is in great danger of loſing the <hi>Neutrality</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> at the <hi>next Seſſion,</hi> (if the Parliament meet) as he loſt its <hi>Alliance</hi> by the <hi>Peace of Holland</hi> at the <hi>laſt;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Lower Houſe</hi> and their Friends (as the furious Proteſtants, and the Malecontents in the Houſe of Lords) have a Deſign to leſſen his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> and root out the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and they think they cannot make uſe of any other fitter means to attain their End, than to <hi>raiſe</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to <hi>perplex his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> as much as lyes in their Power.</p>
                  <p>That his Highneſs doubts not, but it is abſolutely neceſſary for the Intereſt of his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> and his <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to uſe all endeavours to hinder the <hi>meeting of the Parliament,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:153668:5"/> by perſwading his <hi>Britannick Majeſty,</hi> that <hi>his</hi> Greatneſs, <hi>his</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and <hi>his</hi> Quiet, are no leſs concerned therein, than <hi>theirs;</hi> So that if his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> would write freely his thoughts thereupon to his <hi>Br. Majeſty</hi> to forewarn him of the Danger he apprehends from thence, and would withal think fit to make him the ſame generous offers of his <hi>Purſe,</hi> to perſwade him to diſſolve the <hi>preſent Parliament,</hi> as he hath done to his <hi>Highneſs</hi> for the Election of another, perhaps he would ſucceed therein by the Aſſiſtance we would give him here.</p>
                  <p>As for another Parliament, it would be eaſie enough to get ſuch an one as we wiſh for, the Conſtitutions of our Parliaments being of ſuch a nature, that as there is nothing to be hoped for by the King, from an <hi>old</hi> one, ſo there is nothing to be feared from a <hi>new</hi> one, becauſe ſuch an one at their firſt meeting muſt needs aſſiſt his Majeſty, ſo far as to <hi>inable</hi> him to acknowledge his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both to his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> and to all the World.</p>
                  <p>Now, although there is nothing in the World more true, or plainer than this, ſome, nevertheleſs carried on, either by their particular Intereſt, or by their meer Malice, and the hatred they have conceived againſt thoſe they have ſo far offended, as to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair</hi> of their Pardon, are reſolved rather to ſacrifice the Honour of their King, and his Kingdome, than to ſhew him the danger he is running into, and the means to avoid it, leſt they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould <hi>fall into the hands</hi> of thoſe that have long taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Baſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>However, his Royal Highneſs will endeavour by his Care and good Offices to entertain a very <hi>good underſtanding</hi> with the King, his Brother, as he hath alwayes done, and lately, with ſo much ſucceſs, that methinks, he endears himſelf more and more every day.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny,</hi> his Highneſs hath nothing to ſay againſt him: As he ſeems to underſtand the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and to follow it with great Obſervancy, he cannot by conſequence thwart <hi>Ours:</hi> when we ſhall have any thing material to ask or to propoſe to you, you ſhall know it, and we will truſt to the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of your help. I deſire you from <hi>my Maſter,</hi> to deal with us with the ſame <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> and be aſſured, that notwithſtanding all the Rogueries and Follies of ſome People here and there, you will find us always juſt, and <hi>Religiouſly</hi> faithful.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Lect. pro Rege.</note> which he has anſwered to you <hi>himſelf;</hi> and beſides, he hath commanded me to teſtifie to you, the great eſteem he hath for the Friendſhip of his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> and for <hi>yours,</hi> and to aſſure you, that he will not fail to cultivate it with all his power; and that preferring the ſincere Faith of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the word of a <hi>Man of Honour,</hi> before all <hi>Subtilties,</hi> and even all the <hi>advantages</hi> of the World, he gives you them <hi>both,</hi> as a Pledge of the ardent deſire he has to continue alwayes a ſtrict Alliance with <hi>his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> and to entertain alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Correſpondence with <hi>you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt point of your Letter, his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to tell you, that he will govern him ſelf according to <hi>your Advice,</hi> and treat of nothing concerning the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> with <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny,</hi> nor with any other Perſon than your ſelf, but that he will communicate to you all things he ſhall find neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the good of <hi>the Catholicks,</hi> and ſhall be very well pleaſed to receive Advices from you thereupon.</p>
                  <p>For the reſt, his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> does a little wonder, that he hears nothing from <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> touching the <hi>ſecond</hi> point of your Letter, ſince you have written ſo poſitively, that he had order to confirm, and procure execution of what his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty propoſed to him the ſecond of <hi>June laſt,</hi> by your Mediation, and you by that of Sir <hi>William Throckmorton</hi>'s. He <hi>(His R. H.)</hi> has omitted, till this time, to acquaint you with the ſmall ſucceſs that he has had, as expecting daily that <hi>M. Rouvigny</hi> would impart to him the Commiſſion of which you made mention to him in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but having heard nothing yet of that matter, and being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to go out of Town for 15 dayes or three Weeks, he thinks fit to ſend you back Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> to acquaint you with the progreſs of this Buſineſs, and to pray you to inform your ſelf of what has been able to hinder it.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> made a very generous offer to his Royal Highneſs of the <hi>aſſiſtance of his Purſe,</hi> to inable him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>them both</hi> from the Evils that threatned them, and by good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153668:6"/> luck, his Royal Highneſs has labour'd with ſo much diligence and ſucceſs, that the Dangers which they apprehended are a little put off; but <hi>one</hi> thing more is neceſſary for the perfect ſecuring their Affairs; and without making one ſtep <hi>more,</hi> all that he has <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> done will ſignifie nothing. For that the Aſſiſtance of his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> is no leſs neceſſary at preſent, than heretofore, to <hi>ſubdue intirely</hi> thoſe, who being exaſperated againſt his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> as much as againſt his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> and are angry with his Royal Highneſs, onely becauſe he is ſo <hi>unalterably</hi> addicted to the Intereſt of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Malice and their Rage with more <hi>brutality</hi> than ever, if they find occaſion for it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>If you can therefore, by your Credit, obtain from his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty the accompliſhment of the offer of his <hi>Purſe,</hi> for raiſing the Reputation of his Royal Highneſs, in the opinion of his <hi>Britannick Majeſty</hi> and for putting him in condition to reſiſt the ſharpeſt Batteries of the Adverſaries of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Royal Highneſs, to wit, the <hi>poſſibility</hi> they pretend to get Money from the Parliament, and the <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of having any elſewhere, by which they often keep the mind of his <hi>Britannick Majeſty</hi> in ſuſpence, and wherein they place the hope they have to conquer him at laſt.</p>
                  <p>There will nothing more remain to be feared by his Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty, or his Royal Highneſs, but his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> will be able to diſſolve the Parliament with eaſe and afterwards, in recompence of the ſaid <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> will perform on his part all that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall <hi>ask</hi> of him, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with <hi>Sincerity</hi> upon the Word of a <hi>Prince</hi> (that no man can reproach him with the violation of) for the Intereſt of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>

                  <head>A Letter from Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to the <hi>Internuncio,</hi> July 24. 1674.</head>
                  <p>THE Affairs of the Duke are at this time as formerly, in a very uncertain condition. He hath many <hi>Enemies,</hi> and alſo ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> amongſt whom, he particularly eſteemeth <hi>you,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great Confidence in <hi>your</hi> Amity, of which he hopeth to find the good Effects when he ſhall have occaſion to demand your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153668:6"/> 
                     <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> but truly, in the preſent Conjuncture, there is nothing more than to make you underſtand the <hi>Eſtate</hi> in which he is at preſent, and the ſtate of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and to let you conſider what your Friends can do for the Comfort of the one and the other; the firſt is now very well, becauſe of the <hi>putting off the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of the uncertainty whether that Party ſhould take occaſion to perſecute him upon this Affair, or not; if he can deliver himſelf from this difficulty, he will <hi>re-eſtabliſh</hi> himſelf better than ever, and ſhall be capable, not onely to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age his <hi>proper</hi> Affairs, as before, but alſo to teſtifie his Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>thoſe</hi> who have been favourable to him in his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but if this Affair is brought again upon the ſtage, he will be ſo inabled, that he will have all his Adverſaries upon his Back, which at preſent are Civil enough to him, and do run a great Riſque to be ruined with his; all this dependeth on the King, who pretendeth to be effectually the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Friend,</hi> but does nevertheleſs hold an <hi>intimate correſpondence</hi> with his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and too openly declareth himſelf ſometimes, which makes us miſtruſt, that he is perſwaded that his Intereſt is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>oppoſite to ours,</hi> but we muſt not <hi>deſpair.</hi> God is <hi>mighty,</hi> and the innocence of this poor, miſerable — too evident, to permit him to be abandoned of all the World. If, by your means, you can gain the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> to the Duke, for his Aſſiſtance, or to contribute ſomething for the accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating of the differences between his Friends of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> (which cannot give him any <hi>Succor,</hi> becauſe of the infortunate <hi>War,</hi> in which they are ingag'd) you will merit much of God, and of all the Friends of the poor <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who are reduced almoſt to deſpair, and are tormented every day by their <hi>Enemies,</hi> and will be conſtrained to fall every day under the burthen of their <hi>miſeries,</hi> if they are not upheld by ſome means: Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and that of the Duke are alike in <hi>many things,</hi> but do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> have many Enemies, which may, every of them in particular, be againſt the Catholick Cauſe for the Parliament, whereas the Duke, being onely engaged for the <hi>others,</hi> ſhall not be obliged to do any thing, at leaſt, that he ſhall not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Parliament, all the others being of the ſame nature, ſo that none ſhall attacque him in the <hi>laſt,</hi> before this <hi>firſt</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, becauſe, that if the Proceſs comes to be determined in his <hi>favour, our Laws give him a great advantage againſt them which ſhall have the boldneſs to trouble him thereupon.</hi> This is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153668:7"/> all that I can ſay at preſent of the Affair of the Duke, and of the Catholicks, which I recommend to you with <hi>all my heart,</hi> aſſuring you, that ſince <hi>Chriſtianiſm,</hi> there hath not been any Affair neither more to be <hi>pitied,</hi> or more worthy of all the Cares and Zeal of good People, than this of which I now ſpeak to you. If you have the ſame Sentiment, you will take a great part in the Affairs of our Friends, and you will endeavour to apply all the moſt <hi>proper Remedies</hi> to make them <hi>ſucceed.</hi>

                  <p>I AM very much obliged to you for the Letter you were pleaſed to write me concerning my Sickneſs.<note place="margin">Lec' pro Rege.</note> It was long and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and that which troubled me moſt during the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, was, to find my ſelf unable to take care of that Affair you gave me a memorial of, with as much diligence as I could wiſh.

                  <p>YOU expect that the Duke ſhould let you know what your Friends can do for his Service;<note place="margin">Lec'. pro Rege.</note> I told you the laſt Week my Opinion concerning the Eſtate of the Pope, in caſe the Proceſs of the Parliament be judged to his diſadvantage. And I have likewiſe told you what Opinion all the World hath as to that matter, that is to ſay, that it was abſolutely loſt.</p>
                  <p>But, for my part, not being of ſo timorous a nature as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I do not believe ſo, but am of opinion, that it is not impoſſible to overcome our Adverſaries, in ſpight of all the confidence they have of Succeſs. But the Victory which I hope for is, to be able to prevent the Buſineſs coming before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that it be not begun at all, rather than to gain the point, if it ſhall be brought upon the ſtage. For the Fury of the Perſecutors is ſuch, that they will make uſe of all means imaginable, as well Evil as Juſt, to gain their point. And I have too much reaſon to ſuſpect the Integrity of our Judges in that Affair, for I plainly perceive, they naturally incline to the ſide of our Adverſaries. And I dare put no confidence in the Aſſiſtance of the King, after ſo many Demonſtrations as he hath given us of his weakneſs, as to that matter. And it is from theſe three Cauſes; that is to ſay, the Fierceneſs of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, the Injuſtice of our Judges, and the Weakneſs of the King, that we are to expect ſurtable Effects. So that we ſhall have very little hopes of ſucceſs, having ſo many Difficulties to contend with, in caſe the Parliament ſhould meet. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be neceſſary to provide ſome Support among his Friends of your Acquaintance, if his Affairs ſhould be too far puſht to ſuffer him to be in quiet here. All thoſe who have had any Correſpondency with him are at preſent in great ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and in pain to know what Succeſs the Buſineſs above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned is like to have. If the Duke ſucceeds in what he pretends to, they will be more fix'd to him than ever; if he fails, all his Creditors fall upon him in a moment, and he and his Catholick Aſſociates will be abſolutely ruin'd, for it is he alone upon whom all the reſt do intirely depend: So that it is for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153668:8"/> him and his Affairs, that all our Friends ought to employ their Care to keep him up, that he may ſubſiſt. We have none with us that regard the Merit, but the Succeſs of things. So that if the Duke can happily diſingage himſelf of thoſe Difficulties wherewith he is now incumbred, all the World will eſteem him an able man, and all People will intruſt him in their Affairs more willingly than they have done formerly. And the King himſelf, who hath more influence on the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, than all the reſt, will not onely re-eſtabliſh him in the Employment he had before, but will put the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of all his Trade into his hands. By which means, he will have opportunity to enrich himſelf, and all his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſociates, with all their Correſpondents. So that 'tis of great conſequence, (that thoſe who owe him the Sums of) the Emperour and the Pope aſſiſt the Duke with a little Sum of Money, to put him in a condition to re-eſtabliſh himſelf in the Management of the King's Affairs, and to endeavour to Compoſe the Differences between his two Friends of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> So that they may be in a condition to ſupport him in his juſt and worthy Deſign, to begin and eſtabliſh a new Traffick very advantagious to the whole World, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which, at preſent, is unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, for want of being employed as it ought to be, and as it will be in little time after it ſhall have taſted the ſweetneſs of that Profit which it ſhall find by the Managery of the Duke and his Aſſociates, being aſſiſted by his Friends and yours, and principally by the Church. We have in agitation great Deſigns, worthy the conſideration of your Friends, and to be ſupported with all their Power, wherein we have no doubt but to ſucceed, and, it may be, to the utter ruine of the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if you joyn with us in good Earneſt, and cordially ſecond our Enterprizes. The Affair is too long to give you all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of, but, without doubt, you will underſtand much of it by the little which you find here.</p>

Since our return I have received your Letters of the one and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and fourth of <hi>September,</hi> and three others from our Friend, through whoſe hands you ſent me yours.

But, Sir, I deſire you not to believe me guilty of ſo great Lightneſs and Folly, if I ſhall let you know my moſt ſecret Thoughts.

                     </gap> I aſſure you, there is none but my ſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend or Enemy of the Duke's, who doth not believe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that that Buſineſs will be begun again at the time aforeſaid, and that it will terminate to the utmoſt prejudice of the Duke, and of the Catholicks. For my ſelf, I am alone of the opinion, that it will not then be taken up; at leaſt, I will do my utmoſt to prevent it; although I know well that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter, and all thoſe who are for the Intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Confederates
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153668:9"/> (wherof ſome notwithſtanding are very good Friends to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks) will do all they can to prevail with the King to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſaid Buſineſs, preferring their Malice and Enmity againſt <hi>France,</hi> (which will, as they believe, be overwhelmed thereby) before their Love to the Duke and the Catholicks; who will certainly by that means be in great danger to be quite ruined. As for my ſelf, I am neither tied to the Intereſt of <hi>Spain</hi> nor <hi>France,</hi> but intirely to that of the Pope and the Catholicks; but pardon me, if I tell you freely, that I believe that the whole Proceeding of <hi>Spain</hi> in this Conteſt with <hi>France,</hi> is viſibly to the great prejudice, as well of the Pope and the Catholicks, as his own Intereſt, and that He hath been long deceived by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Aſſociates, who have expoſed him, during this whole Affair, to vaſt Expences, and have brought all the Burden upon him, and in the end will quit him in his extremity, if He doth not take heed betimes. All his Friends on this ſide have foreſeen a good while what is faln out of late, and have been much afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee two Gentlemen, of equal Merit, of the ſame Parentage, and of the ſame Intereſt, ſo tranſported one againſt the other, as to expoſe themſelves to the Deriſion of their Neighbours, who have alwayes been, and who are at preſent inwardly (what ſhew ſoever they make in appearance) Enemies to both. In ſhort, I believe that it is not Prudence in <hi>Spain</hi> to ſuffer it ſelf to be thus governed by the Paſſion of its Miniſters, to its own Damage, and the ruine of its beſt Friends, rather than to agree with <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been perfidious, altho <hi>Spain</hi> may have all the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances imaginable, that <hi>France</hi> will act honeſtly for the future, like a good Neighbour, a kind Relation, and a moſt faithful Friend: The Duke's principal Defign is, to terminate this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by the Interpoſition of the Pope, and by that means to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh himſelf in the poſſeſſion of his Eſtate, through their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to turn all their Cares, (which at preſent are employ'd to deſtroy each other) for the Eaſe of the Pope's Friends, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the Catholicks of the Church, againſt their great Enemies. If you pleaſe to conſider the Affair as it is, you will find that the Pope never had an occaſion ſo favourable as at this Hour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich thoſe of his Family, and to augment the number of his Friends, and if he lets it ſlip, he will never find the like: ſo that if ever they propoſe to make uſe of the Treaſure of the Church, 'tis now they ought to do it, for they can demand nothing that the Duke will not be capable to do for the Pope's Friends; and the Emperour, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153668:9"/> as I ſaid: On the other ſide, without their Aid, He will run great hazard of being loſt, both himſelf and his Aſſociates. This is all I can ſay.</p>

                  <p>The third Son of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> known hitherto by the name of my Lord <hi>George Fitz Roy,</hi> hath been lately made Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Viſcount of <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret. Don Carlos,</hi> another of the King's Natural Sons, will be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Earl of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> but his Letters Patenes are not yet figned.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Iriſh</hi> man, named <hi>Cuſſack,</hi> in a ſmall Veſſel of 13 men, had the boldneſs (the laſt Week) to take a <hi>Scotch</hi> Ship in our River, near <hi>Sheerneſs,</hi> and got off: But the Yacht called the <hi>Merlin,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the ſaid <hi>Cuſſack,</hi> and took him, ſo that he and his thirteen men are to be treated as Pirates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, Sir <hi>Jonathan Atkins,</hi> Governour of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to take poſſeſſion of his Charge. His Majeſty will go to <hi>New Market</hi> about the end of this Month, to divert himſelf with Hunting, Horſe races, and the other divertiſements of the Place and Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday the Earl of <hi>Arlington</hi> took poſſeſſion of his Charge of Lord Chamberlain of his Majeſties Houſhold, his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving delivered him the Staff, and this day he hath complemented their Royal Highneſſes, and hath received the Viſits and Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of all his Relations, and Grandees of the Court.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:153668:10"/>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> ſucceeds him in the Charge of Secretary of State, for which he hath taken the ordinary Oath, and hath this day taken his place in Council.</p>
                  <p>As for the Proceſs of your Friend, for which I was in great apprehenſion when I writ to you on the one and twentieth of the laſt Month, it is at preſent (as I hope) in a better condition than formerly; and although his Adverſaries proſecute him with as much vigour, and more confidence than ever; nevertheleſs, I do not doubt but the Lawyers of Mr. — will find out ſome means to avert the danger for the preſent, in deferring it at leaſt for ſome Months; and then it's to be hoped, that his Enemies will begin to hear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that thoſe who had a Deſign to make uſe of this ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture to ſatisfie their Malice, under the ſpecious pretext of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their pretended Debts, and ſecuring their Trade, will ſee, perhaps, that it is not ſo eaſie to maintain a Cheat, and ruine (by their tricks) honeſt People, ſupported by Juſtice and Innocence, as they imagined, after having got that point.</p>
                  <p>Your Friends, the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> will have a fair occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of giving marks of their Friendſhip to Mr. — by joyning their Credit and Intereſt to his, to make the great Deſign (which he hath ſo long meditated, ſucceed, to undermine the Intrigues of that Company of Merchants, who trade for the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to Eſtabliſh that of the aſſociated <hi>Catholicks</hi> in every place, which may be done (without any great trouble) if the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> will grant him their aſſiſtance, and that <hi>Spain</hi> will not too obſtinately oppoſe him; as he hath hitherto done, to his own prejudice; of which I freely told you my Opinion in my laſt, of the Third Inſtant. A little time will now let us ſee the Trade of all Affairs of this nature more clearly than at preſent; In the mean time, you ſee the Confidence and Liberty I uſe with you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>YOU agree with me,<note place="margin">Lec' pro Rege.</note> that Money is the onely means of bringing the King into the Duke's Intereſt, and of difingaging him from the Parliament, and you muſt alſo agree with me, that nothing can more promote the Intereſt of the Catholiek Party, which is the principal Object of the Duke's Care and Affection, and of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153668:10"/> Hatred of the Parliament, and which muſt hope or fear, according as the one or the other of them increaſe in Power.</p>
                  <p>Now the Power would be unalterably eſtabliſhed in the Duke, if the King were reſolved to give him his Aſſiſtance in one or two things, ſo that if Money can prevail with him to act in the Duke's favour, and to abandon the Parliament, the Catholicks will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at great eaſe about it. And if that be the only way to gain the King, that without him the Duke will be in great danger of being ruin'd, and all the Catholicks with him, it imports much to the Duke's Friends, and to the Catholicks, that nothing be omitted for the ſecuring to them aſſiſtance of Mony, as above mentioned. But how ſhall one get it? There's the difficulty. For my part, I do not doubt (notwithſtanding the Diſcourſe which we had together, when I had the honour to ſpeak with you upon this Subject, and when we proceeded upon other Propoſitions than now we do) but that the Pope may do it effectually, if he think fit to employ his whole Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe Money, which is intirely at his command, is more than ſufficient to make the Pretenſions of the Duke and the Catholicks ſucceed; beſides that, the Pope hath many other means to attain the favour of Money.</p>
                  <p>But before it be endeavoured to perſwade the Pope to ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in things of this nature, he muſt firſt be made to underſtand, that the aſſiſtance which he ſhall give the Duke ſhall be hindred from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ineffectual to the Catholicks, either by the lightneſs of the King, or by any other means, and that it ſhall be ſo ordered, as to produce infallibly (or at leaſt, very probably) the Effects which we wiſh for from it.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt, nothing in the World is more certain, than that the King has a good inclination towards the Duke and the Catholicks, and would joyn himſelf willingly, and inſeparably to their Intereſts, if he did not apprehend ſome danger from ſuch a Union, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he would not have any cauſe to fear, if he found their Intereſt, and conſequently their Power, ſo far advanced above that of their Adverſaries, that they ſhould neither have the Power nor the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conteſt any thing with them, or with him, upon any matter that concerned them, which he could ſee in a very little time, if we could perſwade him to treat roundly with Sir <hi>Will. Throckmorton,</hi> and to do two or three things beſides, which would neceſſarily follow the firſt, and which he could not eaſily avoid doing; and I am certain Mony could not fail of perſwading him to it, for there is nothing it cannot make him do, though it were as much to his prejudice, as this we endeavour to perſwade him to, will be to his Advantage.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:153668:11"/>
                  <p>To convince you that the Duke and his Friends would have ſo much the Advantage in their Trade over their Competitors, in caſe they might be aſſiſted by Money, that there would be nothing for the King to apprehend, either of immediate loſs, or Collateral Damage, in preſent or to come; it will be enough that you conſider the infinite augmentation of Credit which they have already gain'd by the bare ſuſpending of their Suit for a little time onely; for if that has been capable of advancing their Intereſt to ſuch a degree, conſider (I beſeech you) how one definitive Sentence in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, muſt needs eſtabliſh both their Reputation and real Power; It would do it to that degree, that, I dare ſay, not one man of thoſe who now balance betwixt them and their Adverſaries, or that ſeem to be even of their Enemies Parry, believing the Advantage of the Suit on their ſide, would dare to croſs or contradict them in any matter whatſoever, in caſe that this point were abſolutely determined in their favour, and even thoſe who have moſt obſtinately oppoſed their Intereſts, would then be as earneſt to ſerve them, and to joyn with them, ſo that their Adverſaries would be wholly ruin'd, and all the Buſineſs be managed intirely by the Duke and his Friends, without any oppoſition: in ſuch ſort, that it will not be in the King's Power to eſtabliſh another Company, although he ſhould be ſo capricious as to deſire it, which he will never do, becauſe he is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to favour thoſe, when he may do it without hazard, and he has nothing to apprehend upon this occaſion, ſince he will find his Intereſt better eſtabliſhed by this means, and with more ſecurity and quiet, than ever it has been hitherto.</p>
                  <p>For my part, that which I have ſaid ſeems ſo evident to me, that nothing leſs than a Miracle can give me greater aſſurance, that the King will never oppoſe the Deſigns of the Duke and his Friends, provided he has once done in their favour what they deſire of him, becauſe he will find his Account in it very advantagiouſly, as he will quickly perceive, when he has made tryal of the Succeſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he does not yet ſee it, and therefore it is neceſſary we ſhould be aſſiſted with Money, to open the Eyes of the King, or to carry him blindly to his own Advantage, which Mony will eaſily do, having ſuch an abſolute Power over him. that he cannot reſiſt it in any thing; and beſides that, the thing which we ask is ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo honourable, and ſo much for his Intereſt, which he will ſee clearly, when he comes to conſider his own Affairs, as he ought, and ſo agreeable to his Inclination, that we want nothing but the aſſiſtance of a Sum of Mony, that may have influence enough upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:153668:11"/> him, to make him reflect upon what concerns him moſt, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, to obtain all that we can deſire of him.</p>
                  <p>As for the Proceſs, we have no great reaſon to apprehend the ſucceſs of it, if money may there give it's honourable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for we are not only aſſured of Juſtice from thoſe Judges who are to determine it, but even of as much Favour as they can reaſonably ſhew us: for ſeeing they have been ſo kind as to defer the Sentence for ſo many Months, in favour of the Duke and his Friends, that they might have occaſion to ſtrengthen their party, when the ordinary Rule and Method of the Law, oblidged them to proceed forthwith to a determination of the Diſpute, which the adverſe Party preſſed with all their power, knowing well, that the Duke and his Friends, were not at all prepar'd to ſupport their Right as was requiſite. The Judges I ſay, being ſo favourable to them as to give them time for the clearing of ſome points which might change the Appearance of the Cauſe, ſo that inſtead of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it as they would certainly have done, without this Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they cannot now fail of Succeſs in it, according to the ſtricteſt Rule of Juſtice, nor need they fear any Oppreſſion of Injuſtice after ſuch proofs of Kindneſs, ſo that the Duke and his Friends aſſiſted by the Teſtimony of Money, which may give ſo much evidence to this Affair, cannot fail of a Deciſion in their Favour, by the aforeſaid Judges.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I perſwade my ſelf, the Pope will never want Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies on the Duke's part, either of his Will or Power, to go through what he undertakes, if the King does not hinder him; for as to the former, he has given ſuch proofs of his Integrity, and Reſolution to continue it unalterably in the greateſt Extremities, that no body can be ſo unjuſt as to ſuſpect him capable of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Action.</p>
                  <p>And as to his Power, there are ſo many Inſtances to be given in other Perſons, who have been leſs concern'd and leſs able than himſelf, and yet have been ſo ſucceſsful in the ſame Attempts, that there is no reaſon in this Caſe to doubt of it. Remember (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) what happened at — in the year — and compare the perſons Enterprizes, and all other Circumſtances of thoſe times, with theſe, and then tell me (if you pleaſe) why one may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as good an effect now, as then; but if Mony alone be able to produce Effects of this kind in the preſent Conjuncture of Affairs, you will doubtleſs, agree with me, that it is requiſite to employ it on this Occaſion, if ever we pretend to uſe it on any. And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153668:12"/> indeed, there is no Appearance that ſo much Labour and Care have been uſed for ſo long time to encreaſe the Power of the Church, to render it unuſeful for ever.</p>
                  <p>As to the Journey of (Mr. <hi>Gabriel</hi>) the Internuncio, ſeeing he is fond of it, I am content, becauſe he will have better opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of promoting the Duke's Intereſt with the Pope and Emperour at <hi>Rome,</hi> than elſewhere; for my part, I ſhould not correſpond with his Succeſſor, without Monſieur <hi>Gabriel</hi>'s Expreſs Order, or ſome of his Friends, becauſe I may continue the Negotiation of our Affair immediately with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as by any other way, which would not advance, but rather retard the Buſineſs. I ſhould think my ſelf very happy, if I might ſee him in his paſſage to — but if that may not be, I ſhall be glad to get leave of my Maſter to meet him at — to kiſs his hands, and to give him the greateſt aſſurances of my being intirely his, as I profeſs to be,</p>

                        <hi>As to what you ſay of the Pope's Obligations to aſſiſt other Friends, who are under greater Preſſures, I anſwer, That perhaps the Affairs of the King of</hi> France <hi>may be more preſſing than theirs, and alſo than thoſe of the Duke, for the Duke may poſſibly be able to overcome all his Difficulties without any aſſiſtance from abroad, though not without much trouble and hazard, but I ſhould think the beſt, and honeſt way of aſſiſting the King of</hi> France <hi>effectually, would be for the Pope to joyn with the Duke, and to endeavour, with their Credit with</hi> Spain, <hi>and other Catholick Princes, ro unite themſelves in a Company, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the King of</hi> France <hi>into it, to the end, that being joyned in the ſame Company, they might have but one common Intereſt, and they would be able to Govern the whole Traffick at their Pleaſure, and the Proteſtants and all other Nations would be obliged to give them what they would ask for all they ſhould expect, and to ſell them their Merchandizes at their own price; becauſe there would be no other Merchants of whom they could buy, or to whom they could ſell, but to thoſe of this Company, which would bring them in an incredible Advantage, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more eaſie than to eſtabliſh this Company, if the Pope would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his Aſſiſtance, as aboveſaid.</hi>

                  <p>IT is true, Sir, that the Pope hath given us a clear and evident mark of his affection toward the Catholicks of <hi>England;</hi> but the Internuntio hath teſtified no leſs in doing Juſtice to the Merits of Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which he mentioned in his Letter of the 6th of <hi>July.</hi> Since we have reaſon to attribute his ſucceſs to the (juſt or favourable) character that the Internuntio hath given of him, I do not at all apprehend that the Internuntio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth himſelf of the good offices that he hath done him, but that he will finde them recompenced by the ſatisfaction which he will receive in his Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>As for (Monſieur <hi>Clement</hi>) the Duke, I believe that he hath already found the effects of your Prayers; and that he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſurmounted all the Difficulties which have oppoſed his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment: The face of his Affairs are well changed; for we now paſſionately wiſh to ſee the coming on of the Parliament which we ſo much feared before: And while it was held doubtful whether it ought to meet or no, we employed all our Power to bring it on; which point we have gained but within theſe few days. And for my part, I no ways doubt but that we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as much good by it, as we apprehended ill, provided that the Duke fail not in the execution of the good Reſolutions which he hath taken. There is but one thing to be feared (whereof I have a very great apprehenſion) that can hinder the ſucceſs of our Deſignes; which is a Diviſion amongſt the Catholicks themſelves, which hath already broke out at <hi>Paris</hi> amongſt ſome Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> touching ſome difference of Opinions in their Debates.</p>
                  <p>I finde that ſome of them have ſent their Complaints to <hi>Rome,</hi> to have their Antagoniſt condemned: I have an intimate Acquaintance with the Perſon complained of, and I dare affirm he hath made twice as many Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> of thoſe which were none before, as any other perſon of his Quality; and that he is as well inclined towards the Pope and his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as the beſt of his Accuſers: And I aſſure you, he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends here of the Firſt Rank of Catholicks, who would not engage in his Affairs, if they did not believe that he marched
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153668:13"/> ſteadily towards the common end. Although he affecteth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to expreſs himſelf ſomewhat different from ſome of his Brothers. As for me, I believe there is too much paſſion on both ſides; and if it ſhall fall out that his Enemies prevail againſt him, and procure his Condemnation at <hi>Rome,</hi> I am afraid that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others will take occaſion from thence to fall upon many Catholicks before the Parliament, deſiring its friendſhip about ſome extravagant Propoſitions concerning the Authority of the Pope, to which the other Catholicks cannot ſubmit; which will give occaſion to the Parliament to accord their conjunction to thoſe who require it, upon the Conditions before-mentioned; that is, Conditions prejudicial to the Authority of the Pope, by the hatred which they bear to all the Religion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, becauſe they may perſecute the reſt of them with more appearance of Juſtice, and ruine the one half of them more eaſily than the whole body at once. So that it ſeemeth to me, that although the Religion ſhould be much more ſeverely dealt with, by reaſon of their Complaint, than now it is, it would be very improper in the preſent Conjuncture of our Affairs, to make any diviſion betwixt the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But for my part, I do not perceive any prejudice that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal the Religion from any of thoſe things, againſt which ſome perſons ſeem to be ſo furiouſly enraged; becauſe to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, there is nothing contained in them, but what hath heretofore been maintained by Men of Worth and Honeſty, with the general approbation of the whole world; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by <hi>D. Elizalde</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in his Book Intituled, <hi>De for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma verae Religionis quaerendae &amp; inveniendae.</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153668:13"/> Pope or any of his Family to embark themſelves in the Affair, which would raiſe ſome diſpute amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>I beg your pardon for the trouble I have given you upon this Subject: but knowing your goodneſs, and weighing the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Affair, wherein I have taken the liberty to beg your aſſiſtance, I doubt not but you will pardon, <hi>SIR.</hi>

Oblige me in acquainting me as often as poſſible you can, how that matter proceeds; and particularly, whether it will come quickly to a hearing as thoſe of his ſide intended, or whether it is like to be put off to a longer time; the Emperor is in tirely his, and the Inter-Nuntio has this week received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from him, wherein he commands him to aſſure the Duke of the paſſionate zeal he has for his Service, and thoſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks. I pray you acquaint the Duke with it, and aſſure him that the Inter-Nuntio has alſo the ſame inclinations, as he will make appear on all occaſions that ſhall preſent themſelves; but it muſt be the Duke himſelf muſt direct in what we may contribute to his Service. The Pope alſo will give his aſſiſtance in ſuch things as are proper for him to appear in. I beg of you to communicate your News to me as often as you can, by ſuch ways as you ſhall judge moſt convenient, and am in the mean time, without reſerve,</p>

I was raviſhed to find by the laſt, that the Tryal will be put off to another time, againſt the general opinion. Without doubt this will extreamly rejoyce the Pope and the Emperor, whereof the firſt imployeth all his power to accommodate the differences between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and I doubt not, but the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of contributing by this means, to the advantage of the Duke and of the Catholicks, will further incite him to ſolicite this affair, upon the relation which the Nuncio will make to the Pope of the importance of its ſucceſs, for the Catholiques of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Emperor, he is ſo zealous for the Dukes ſervice, that I am aſſured he will omit nothing on his ſide to facilitate whatever he ſhall find tend to the good iſſue of this Affair, whereof I will write to him particularly. Continue only to impart to me all the light that may ſerve to direct what is to be treated on; I hope the next winter will give opportunity for more happy Negotiations, even to the Mediation of the Pope, who hitherto hath not been able to act at all, as you have known from other parts.

                  <p>I Agree with you, that the only means to win the King to the Duke's Intereſt, and to take him off intirely from the Friendſhip of the Parliament, would be Money, for the Reaſons you alledge in your laſt Letter of the 2d inſtant, which I have juſt now received; but the means neceſſary to continue it are ſo exceſſive, that even according to your own opinion, and the diſcourſe we had when you was here, what the Pope could contribute would be nothing in compariſon of what is needed: and in the obligation he hath alſo to aſſiſt other Friends who are in greater ſtraits. I likewiſe doubt whether the Pope would reſolve upon what you propound, conſidering the little ſtreſs can be laid upon the Kings will, it being to be feared, that all imployed that way would ſoon be loſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any advantage to the Duke or his Aſſociates, which we have reaſon to fear from his ordinary manner of proceeding. It would therefore be neceſſary in my opinion to have at leaſt ſome propable aſſurances that we might imploy for the advantage of the Catholicks, and <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

For what remains, the Nuntio is upon the point of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> having already leave to return. The Negotiation of the buſineſs you propound, will belong to his Succeſſour; but he will retain the ſame paſſion which he had for the Dukes Service, as well at the Emperors Court, as at the Popes, if he ſhall have any part in the Affairs of <hi>England.</hi> He will not fail to inform you more particularly of his departure.

                  <p>YOurs of the 30 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> came not to my hands till the laſt week, by the means of our common friend who liveth in this City, which I am obliged to tell you, that you may not think I have forgot my duty in delaying my Anſwer ſo long.</p>
                  <p>I am over-joyed to underſtand by the news you write me, the good condition in which the Affairs of the Duke and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks are at preſent, and for what concerneth the matter of which I have been more particularly informed by your friend, I will not fail ſpeedily to acquaint the Emperour, and it is he who is all powerful with the Pope, with the reaſons why it is for the benefit of the Catholicks, to defer the execution of that cenſure, which might cauſe ſome diviſions among them, and give occaſion of advantage to the Parliament thereby. My ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hath been received very favourably, ſo that I am not only aſſured that they will delay for ſome long time the deſign of that buſineſs, but I hope alſo that the matter may poſſibly end ſo, as the perſon whom you recommend, doth deſire.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:153668:18"/>
                  <p>The conſideration of the connexion which all this may have with the intereſts of the Duke, hath been the moſt prevailing motive to the perſons with whom I have been obliged to treat in this affair, to perſwade them to what you did deſire, and you may know by that, the paſſion that there is in this place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to all things which they believe are for his ſervice. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to aſſure him of the zeal with which I will always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my ſelf therein. I am, without reſerve,</p>

                  <p>YOurs of the 21 of the laſt Month, which juſt now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, hath given me much trouble, by the dangerous condition whereunto the Dukes Proceſs is reduced. I wiſh I were able to contribute to his ſervice by the means of my Friends, and particularly of the Emperor and the Pope. But hitherto I ſee not wherein they can advantage him. The Pope endeavours, what, you obſerve, which would be the propereſt remedy for his Affair, but the Parties will not yet declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that buſineſs. If you will explain your ſelf, what may be done on this ſide, in the preſent occurrences of Affairs, I doubt not but all that is poſſible will be done.

                  <p>I Cannot forbear to Write to you once more this Week, having Two things to ſay to you; The one is, That I have ſeen Mr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> who intends to go to Trade ſecretly in your Parts. He will depart in 8, or 10 Days, but take no notice of it, leſt it be known from whence you had it. He would have had me carried him to ſee the King's Confeſſor, whoſe Favour he endeavours to get by all means and helps. He will not paſs for a Merchant, and therefore he wears a Sword
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153668:19"/> by his ſide, and lives with the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin:</hi> Both of them, I am told, Proſecute the Affair concerning which he hath written to you, and that you Communicate it to me. The other thing is, That the King's Confeſſor tells us, That the King of <hi>France</hi> thinks in earneſt to recall Monſieur <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> from your Traffick; but he that is to be ſent in his Place, does not pleaſe Mr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> becauſe, as he ſays, he is not of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Merchants of this place, though he have a great deal of Wit; and I am of his Mind, as well for this Reaſon as for others that are known to me, and which I cannot yet impart to you. Wherefore if Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> would know of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> if there be any Merchant here that would be acceptable to him, he may acquaint Monſieur <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> with it, and he will take care that by the means of the King's Confeſſor, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd effectually to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This would be very well for the Traffick of the Catholicks.</p>

This cannot but produce a very good effect with (163) the King of <hi>France.</hi> He will ſee thereby that People eſteem him in the Countrey of (110) <hi>England.</hi> And that (39 and 93) the Duke and Dutcheſs, being ſo far ſatisfied with him, as to give him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153668:20"/> Commiſſions, he will become more engaged to give ear to the Letter of Recommendation of (39) the Duke, which (35) <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuculi</hi> has promis'd to ſend (49) <hi>St. Germain,</hi> though he has not yet done it.

And though he is without (80) Money, he will not ceaſe to act as he ought, with Zeal and Fidelity, provided he be not ſent elſewhere, but left where he is; which yet may happen after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> he having no imployment to detain him where he is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (62) <hi>Coleman</hi> write to (488) the King's Confeſſor, <hi>either from, or as from</hi> (39 and 93) <hi>the Duke and Dutcheſs, to ſignifie to him that thoſe two Perſons deſire to make uſe of him, as a Correſpondent in their Traffick between them</hi> (62, and 488, and 163) Coleman, <hi>and the Confeſſor, and the King of</hi> France. <hi>In which caſe</hi> (49) St. Germain <hi>would take his time to act in favour of</hi> (62) Coleman <hi>with</hi> (488, and 163) <hi>the Confeſſor and the King of</hi> France, <hi>and to bring to paſs that</hi> (62) Coleman <hi>ſhall obtain</hi> (26) <hi>a Penſion of</hi> 100000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling <hi>for himſelf.</hi> If (49) <hi>St. Germain</hi> receive the Letters which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from (35) <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> and they have their effect, he will have <hi>wherewith to pay the Charge</hi> of his remaining where he is, and of all the Affairs of <hi>Commerce,</hi> whereof Commiſſions ſhall be given him. (49) <hi>St. Germain</hi> will have no need of (80) Money, till after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> But at that time, if the Letters of (39) the Duke to (163) the King of <hi>France</hi> hath no ſucceſs, it will be impoſſible for him to enter into the Commerce, unleſs (62) <hi>Coleman</hi> obtain from (93 or 39) the Dutcheſs or Duke, one quarter more, like that which he received being in the Countrey of (110) <hi>England;</hi> that is to ſay, between Thirty and Forty Pounds <hi>ſterling.</hi> And if this be once done for all, it will give him the Means to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Eaſe for above a Year; during which time, he hopes to put himſelf into a Condition of ſerving all the World, without importuning any body for ever.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153668:21"/> be any from you to me. In thoſe they ſend me, I expect the Dutcheſſes Letter, to deſire Monſieur <hi>St. Germain</hi> to Treat with the King of <hi>France.</hi> Juſt now I have received a Letter brought me from <hi>England;</hi> but there is none from you. I thank you for your Good will for the Lady. Send me News of Mr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> (an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt) what he does in <hi>England,</hi> will he ſtay there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways? Monſieur <hi>St. Germain</hi> thanks Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> for the Marks of Friendſhip he gives him.

And 'tis abſolutely Neceſſary that it be known in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Shop; otherwiſe it will hurt his Commerce. It ſuffices me to know that the Dutcheſs has received the Letter of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>St. Germain.</hi> It was nothing but a pure Civility, touching the condition ſhe is in; and an Affair was recommended to her, which is done ſince.

                  <p>THe ſlow arrival of your Letters, hath very much diſquieted me, I thought my ſelf Dead in your Remembrance; But that which you writ to me, of the 2/12 of <hi>March,</hi> hath again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153668:22"/> me to Life (at leaſt for ſome time); for the dulneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Buſineſs that you wot of, is carried on, will (I fear) let me die no other Death; and that, for Reaſons which you will hear of too ſoon. Thoſe of the Catholick Religion, have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to write to you, to let <hi>Coleman</hi> know the Condition of their Affairs; which is, that being for the preſent out of Purſe, it is altogether impoſſible for them to keep up their Trade long, without his help. Beſide, That the Party apprehendeth that his Trade failing in the Shop where he now is, he ſhall after <hi>Easter,</hi> be ſent to ſet up in ſome other Town. But if he could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the D. of <hi>York,</hi> the Papers for which he hath ſo long waited, he might probably e're this time, have concluded his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with the <hi>French</hi> King, by the Means of the King's Confeſſor; and he might have put himſelf in a condition to have continued his Trade, to the Advantage of thoſe in whoſe favour thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were written; for having no Imployment in his Shop, for want of Money, it is impoſſible that he ſhould keep it long; ſince he wanteth Opportunity to make himſelf appear uſeful to the Service of the Duke and Dutcheſs; having no order to act in any thing whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>I am overjoy'd with what <hi>Coleman</hi> hath ſaid to the Dutcheſs, and with what the Duke hath done for the grand Treaſurer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Germain</hi> hath made himſelf Enemies, by maintaining the Opinion, That the Dutcheſs ought to be prevailed with, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage her Affairs otherwiſe than ſhe hath hitherto done. I would gladly underſtand what Anſwer the Dutcheſs hath made to <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> St. Germain <hi>buildeth great hopes upon what</hi> Coleman <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to him, about the Diſcourſe which the Duke held with the grand Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer.</hi> But <hi>Coleman</hi> may conſider, That if the Duke ſhall Treat any thing with the <hi>French</hi> King, through other hands than the Confeſſors, he ſhall meet with People that will couzen him, and who will prefer the good of <hi>France,</hi> before that of the Catholick Religion, and of the Duke; and principally of <hi>Coleman,</hi> who hath many Rivals about his R. Highneſs; and who is neither ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known to, nor hath any Intereſt with the <hi>French</hi> King: If Monſieur <hi>St. Germain</hi> were a little acquainted with Matters, he would Diſcourſe them freely with the Confeſſor; and learning from him the bottom of the Matter, he would (without Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) Communicate all to <hi>Coleman;</hi> whereas now it is to be feared, that the other Negotiators Cheat the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>France,</hi> or for their own particular Intereſt; for the chief Miniſter in the Councils of War, who hath at preſent an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power over his Chriſtian Majeſty, is altogether for War;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153668:22"/> which is neither the Buſineſs of <hi>England,</hi> nor of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Be ſure, that you make <hi>Coleman</hi> fully ſenſible of all this; for it is one of their moſt indiſputable Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Germain</hi> hath deſired me to tell you, That it is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make <hi>Coleman</hi> underſtand what he deſireth concerning the Lady's Buſineſs; who, if you ſo pleaſe, will henceforth go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of Madam <hi>de la Tremblay:</hi> Becauſe he plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that thoſe Perſons who know altogether as much of that Affair as he, ſtand upon their reſerve; and will not diſcloſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in what they know, nay of what they have acted with him. Nevertheleſs, I will tell you (in hope that it ſhall go no farther than our ſelves) (no, not ſo much as to take notice of it to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de la Tremblay</hi>) that <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> and the D. of <hi>York</hi> are the Two firſt who ever thought of putting it into the Dutcheſſe's head, to think cloſer of the Traffick than ſhe had done; and that therefore finding no body in her own Shop who was able to make her ſenſible of the Importance of that Affair, and the means to ſucceed in it; and that ſhe had thoſe Counſellors about her, which made her do things that were likely to ruine her whole Commerce; they concluded, that it was neceſſary to place ſome able and truſty Perſon about her. They refuſed to make choice of any of the Dutcheſs's own Countrey, by reaſon of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which they had of him who was there already; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they underſtand not the way of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men; as not having the Acquaintance of any, in whom they might confide. The Perſon nominated was eſteemed very proper, as well for his own Merit, as becauſe that Choice would oblige Monſieur <hi>Rouvigni,</hi> the Catholick Party, and conſequently the <hi>French</hi> King, to Declare for the Duke and Dutcheſs.</p>
                  <p>And that this Perſon being of the Catholick Party, and <hi>Rouvig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> of the Proteſtant, both ſides would be well pleaſed. To bring this Matter about, <hi>St. Germain,</hi> by the advice of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed the Matter with Madam <hi>de la Tremblay,</hi> who hath as you know, all Power over the Perſon upon whom they had caſt their Eyes, to be plaeed in the Dutcheſs's Shop. Madam <hi>de la Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blay</hi> offered her Aſſiſtance in all that they deſired. The Matter was then to be approved by the Duke and Dutcheſs. <hi>Montecuculi</hi> communicated it by Letter, to the Banker, his Maſter (whoſe Correſpondent in <hi>England,</hi> the Dutcheſs is) who embraced the Propoſals, and promiſed to write thereof to the Dutcheſs, as he ſoon after did; but touched the Matter tenderly, being content at firſt to recommend to her the Care of his Buſineſs; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153668:23"/> to have a more watchful Eye over it than formerly; and to take along with her the Advice of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who was acquainted with all his Thoughts, and rightly ſet to contribute his beſt Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance toward the Succeſs of his Affair. The Dutcheſs thereupon enquired of <hi>Montecuculi</hi> what was expected for her to do? <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculi</hi> gave her her Leſſon in Writing, to ſtudy it at her leiſure, and without expreſſing the Matter plainly, inſinuated to her, that ſhe wanted a good Apprentice to take care of her Shop, and keep an exact Account of all that paſſed through his hands. That her eldeſt Apprentice had not Wit enough, That the Second was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Affairs of <hi>England;</hi> and did not underſtand a word that was ſaid to him. That he ſet himſelf to no Buſineſs; nay, that he was of a malicious Spirit, making ill Impreſſions in the Dutcheſs of all the Boys in the Shop, to preſerve himſelf ſingle in her favour. That the Third was Dull, Careleſs, Scornful, and an Enemy to all Activity. All this was ſaid to the Dutcheſs by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuculi;</hi> not indeed ſo downright as I have expreſſed it, yet ſo as the Dutcheſs might underſtand it if ſhe pleaſed; and I believe ſhe did ſo; but inſtead of receiving it as ſhe ought, ſhe ſeemed to be out of humour; and hath not (as I know) ſince that time, written any Anſwer to <hi>Montecuculi;</hi> but hath avoided all manner of Correſpondence with him. Wherefore <hi>Montecuculi</hi> and <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> thought fit to proceed another way, and make the Duke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what the Dutcheſs would not ſeem to underſtand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Montecuculi</hi> diſcourſed the Matter with the E. of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> without acquainting him that they had any deſign to place the Friend of Madam <hi>Tremblay</hi> in the Shop; but barely to engage him to acquaint the Duke, with the ill conduct of the Dutcheſs; and to lay before him the Neceſſity of applying ſome proper and powerful Remedy. But afterward <hi>Montecuculi</hi> and <hi>St. Germain</hi> ſought other Perſons leſs intereſſed, and better inclined than the E. of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> for this Buſineſs. And if <hi>Coleman</hi> pleaſe, he may call to mind the diſcourſe which <hi>St. Germain</hi> had with him upon this Subject, repreſenting to him the Neceſſity there then was of placing a Head Apprentice or Fore-man in the Dutcheſs's Shop. Nevertheleſs he did not then ſpeak all out, becauſe the Friend of Madam <hi>de la Tremblay,</hi> being not then in <hi>England,</hi> they expected his return, to know of him if he would be content that <hi>Coleman</hi> ſhould be admitted to the knowledge of the Matter.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly <hi>St. Germain</hi> writ to Madam <hi>la Tremblay</hi>'s Friend, who was then in <hi>France,</hi> to preſs his ſpeedy coming over, that we mght act joyntly, and without loſs of time,</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:153668:23"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Germain</hi> had likewiſe Treated for Two other Perſons; one of them he laboured to put into the good eſteem of the Dutcheſs, and ſucceeded therein; and by the aſſiſtance of the Firſt, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Second. They are both well with the Duke. But herein <hi>St. Germain</hi> gave himſelf work enough; for theſe Two laſt Perſons are ſuch, that <hi>St. Germain</hi> neither can, nor will Treat with, by any but himſelf; and he hath ſuch private Reaſons for it, that he dares not expreſs them; and ſo forcible, that if he ſhould utter them, all the World muſt be of his Opinion, and do as he doth. He undertook likewiſe to taſte (but obſcurely) the mind of the Duke's Confeſſor, in cenſuring the weak conduct of the Dutcheſs's Ghoſtly Father, by laying open the miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Dutcheſs, which required a ſpeedy and vigorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all the Proceedings, as likewiſe the Contrivances of <hi>St. Germain</hi> to gain his two unknown Friends, which could not yet be carried ſo cloſe, but that ſome Obſervations have been made of them; but none could ever diſcover the true Cauſe of the groundleſs Jealouſies which have been raiſed upon <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;</hi> and which hath been the chiefeſt Reaſon that he hath been abandoned in his Misfortunes, and that no body concerneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reſcue him out of them. Thus you have the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Buſineſs, which hath been ſo vigorouſly agitated with <hi>Coleman,</hi> the E. of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> the two unknown Perſons, and the Duke's Confeſſor, upon the arrival of the Friend of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de la Tremblay</hi> in <hi>England</hi> with intent (had not the accident befallen <hi>St. Germain</hi>) to perſuade the Duke to conſent to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the work; and after his conſent obtained, to have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to the Dutcheſs, by her grand Banker <hi>Montecuculi:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A faire la Coup.</note> I ſhould utterly deſpair if any, beſide your ſelf, were made acquainted with this whole Matter. I hope <hi>St. Germain</hi> will Pardon me the laying open of his whole Secret to you: But I doubt whether he would be pleas'd that <hi>Montecuculi</hi> ſhould know that he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it to you. Well then, Let <hi>Montecuculi</hi> come, and try if he would or could re-enter into the ſame Negotiation with <hi>Coleman,</hi> the E. of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and the Confeſſor of the Duke; who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is highly diſpleaſed with the Dutcheſs's Confeſſor, and with others, whom you will judge proper for this Deſign. As for my ſelf, who have no other part in it, but to advertiſe you thereof, you may judge how unprofitable I am. But if the Duke would be perſuaded to write hither, That he wiſheth, or at leaſt that he judgeth it fit, that <hi>St. Germain</hi> ſhould appear in <hi>England.</hi> I know that the Two concealed Gentlemen would contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153668:24"/> it the utmoſt of their Power; and that then the Duke will be more Powerful than ever amongſt them, to make them act vigorouſly. But this is a Fancy of my Brain, to which <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> will not be brought, as judging it impoſſible; principally in regard of the Enemies which the Enterprize of this Affair hath raiſed him.</p>

                  <p>I Have received yours, of the 9/19 <hi>March,</hi> and omitted to write to you for two Poſts; by reaſon I received no Letters from you, I have given you an exact account of the Affair of our Friend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de la Tremblay,</hi> in my laſt Letters; to which I expect your Anſwer. <hi>St. Germain</hi> went Yeſterday to Viſit the Confeſſor, and to deliver him the Dutcheſs's Letter for the King of <hi>France;</hi> and this day he is to carry him a Memorial, to the End he may ſpeak Effectually to the King; and to the Satisfaction of the Dutcheſs. The Confeſſor hath received Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letter, and <hi>St. Germain</hi> hath already acquainted Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> with it; but his Great Affairs hath made him forget it; If the Confeſſor hath not anſwered it, it is becauſe he expected the Dutcheſs's Letter, to anſwer both at once, after he ſhall have ſeen the Iſſue of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. It's ſaid, That the King of <hi>France</hi> hath been very Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly for ſome days (being a Lover of his Countrey) the Affair of <hi>Meſsina</hi> cauſes his Diſcontent; Others ſay, That he had formed ſome deſign (this year) for Trade, which hath been fruſtrated; Others, That it is only by reaſon of this time of Devotion; He would ſometimes walk all alone, contrary to his Cuſtom. It's ſaid the Emperor Arms very powerfully. The Electreſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> is dead, and the Empreſs very ſick; Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> the great Poiſoner, is taken Priſoner at <hi>Liege;</hi> They are demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing <hi>Hug, Dinant,</hi> and the Cittadel of <hi>Liege:</hi> It's ſaid for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the King will part from <hi>Paris, Wedneſday</hi> after <hi>Easter,</hi> which will be the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> our Stile.</p>
                  <p>I have received yours of the 16/26 <hi>March,</hi> I could not ſend you this laſt <hi>Saturday;</hi> I ſend it on our Holy <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> being the 22 <hi>March</hi>/1 <hi>April. St. Germain</hi> deſires me to tell you, that you will do him a great favour to thank Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> for all good Offices in his behalf;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153668:24"/> for which he can never ſufficiently return Thanks; he is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Confeſſors with you, had great reaſon to forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize on his Proceedings; which he would Condemn himſelf, if he had not the Reaſons, which he told Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and which are ſuch in the preſent ſtate of Affairs, that if thoſe two Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were in his Place, they would do the ſame. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> will alſo do him a Kindneſs, to make his Complements to Mr. <hi>Mountecuculi,</hi> whom he knows to be in all things his true Friend. For his Voyage into <hi>England,</hi> he leaves it in the Hands of Providence; but he doth not believe that we ought to begin, by engaging the Confeſſor to ſollicit this Affair, unleſs the Duke doth deſire it, or think it fit; <hi>The Duke's Lord Treaſurer is very well diſpoſed to the good Succeſs of this Buſineſs,</hi> as they tell <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;</hi> and he hath <hi>reaſon to believe it True.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is Neceſſary (I ſay) abſolutely Neceſſary, that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> make himſelf better Known in <hi>France,</hi> and to the King of <hi>France</hi> and his Confeſſor, by Negotiations concerning his Traffick; Therefore <hi>St. Germain</hi> wiſhes, That the Duke had ſome Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſend him into <hi>France,</hi> to Treat of ſome Point of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; becauſe appearing and acting, they would Intereſt him more deeply in the Trade. <hi>St. Germain</hi> hath given a Memorial to the Confeſſor, concerning the Affair of <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor hath put it (in the preſence of <hi>St. Germain</hi>) in the Pacquet with the Dutcheſs's Letter to the King of <hi>France;</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor hath promiſed <hi>St. Germain</hi> to ſpeak very earneſtly of this Affair; He went to Court on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, where he will ſtay 8 days; becauſe in that time they are accuſtomed to take a review together of the whole years account. Above all, <hi>St. Germain</hi> hath recommended to the Confeſſor to act ſo, that the King of <hi>France</hi> might write back to the Dutcheſs, who was angry the laſt year, that ſhe received no Anſwer to a Letter ſhe writ to him. If Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did take a turn into <hi>France,</hi> I do not doubt but he <hi>might obtain ſomething Conformable to the Promiſes of Mr.</hi> Ruvigny; <hi>but then he muſt be impowered in this Voyage, by the Duke's Commiſsions.</hi> Send me ſome News of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> whom I will hereafter call 98; and of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> whom I will call 89; for ſeveral things are diſcourſed here, both of the one, and the other.

                  <p>I Do almoſt like you, I write not to you when you write not to me; and ſend you only ſmall Letters, when you ſend not me great ones; and beſides, our News is yet very little. The King goes from hence to Morrow, but it is not yet known whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome ſay, to Beſiege <hi>Cambray;</hi> others ſay, towards <hi>Sedan,</hi> to be betwixt <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> there are ſome who will have the King to go to <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> to oblige the Enemy to a Battel, at which he hath a great deſire once to be.</p>
                  <p>For other things, <hi>St. Germain</hi> deſires you will tell Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> that the King's Confeſſor hath poſitively aſſured him, That the <hi>French</hi> King will write to the Dutcheſs concerning the Buſineſs that is on foot; the Confeſſor told it to <hi>St. Germain</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he believes it will be to the Satisfaction of the Dutcheſs. The Confeſſor alſo added upon what St. <hi>Germain</hi> repreſented to him, That the <hi>French</hi> King leaving his home to make a round to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Enemies, could not ſo conveniently ſend the Letter of Exchange to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as was deſired, if he did dot do it before his departure; That the <hi>French</hi> King thought upon theſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as well Abroad as at Home: It is Neceſſary that <hi>Coleman</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>St. Germain</hi> of what ſhall happen, and if the Dutcheſs have received an Anſwer, and what it is. Madam <hi>Tremblay</hi> writ a Letter of <hi>March</hi> 26 Nevv Stile to <hi>St. Germain,</hi> in vvhich vvas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt that <hi>Coleman</hi> had not ſeen her in Ten days, to tell her what he had done. Madam <hi>Tremblay</hi> hath writ to Madam <hi>Ruvigny</hi>'s Brother, to oblige him to ſpeak to the King's Confeſſor in favour of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> to procure him a Journey into <hi>England,</hi> if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsor had asked <hi>St. Germains</hi> advice upon't, he would have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled him not to take that way which can never do well.</p>
                  <p>The new Ambaſsador's Secretary is very earneſt with <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> to befriend him with the Confeſsor, and ſeems very zealous for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but <hi>St. Germain</hi> would know if this Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary be as well with the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as he would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>and if the Duke hath all along truſted him with the ſecret of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. St. Germain</hi> entertains him with fair Promiſes, by that means to underſtand things which may be uſeful to his Friends, and chiefly to <hi>Coleman.</hi> This Secretary is much aſtoniſhed at the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153668:25"/> rumour that is here of the Duke of <hi>York, having received no News of it;</hi> and <hi>St. Germain</hi> is a little angry at <hi>Coleman,</hi> that he hath writ nothing to him of it.</p>

                  <p>I Did not believe Sir, that I ſhould have written to you this day, becauſe Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> will himſelf write to you, to whom I told all my News; ſo that you are to expect none from me now. You may aſſure Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> that Monſieur <hi>St. Germain</hi> will deliver that Letter to Madam <hi>la Tremblay,</hi> which he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to her; but at the ſame time that he promiſed it, he ſaid that he had not lately heard any thing of her, nor could he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tell whether ſhe were yet arrived, but he would make a diligent Inquiry, and pay his Devoire in all things to Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and would perform even more than was deſired when ever he could. Monſieur <hi>St. Germain</hi> is in good earneſt highly Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> for all thoſe Induſtrious pains he takes upon his Account, and in a particular manner for thoſe Papers we wanted, that he wants Language to expreſs his Gratitude. Monſieur <hi>St. Germain</hi> has received a Letter from the King's Confeſſor, and from the Ambaſſador, wherein he is to make his Addreſs to that Confeſſor, that the Succeſſor of <hi>St. Germain</hi> be not ſent, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any other of the <hi>French</hi> Nation; as Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſeems to be ingaged in this Paper, <hi>St. Germain</hi> intreated me to write every thing which related to <hi>Coleman,</hi> who was thereupon to take his Meaſures; for I ſee very well, that Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> is ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the Duke and <hi>Coleman,</hi> and I much apprehend his giving the ſame Sentiments to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and to his Confeſſor, and the Miniſter of State: And therefore Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> muſt manage carefully this Affair, without the leaſt taking notice that he knows any thing from Monſieur <hi>St. Germain;</hi> you muſt take eſpecial care not to prejudice our Friend, that he may be the better able to Traffick with the King's Confeſſor, and Mr. <hi>Sheldon.</hi> As to the reſt, you muſt know that the Duke has conſented that <hi>St. Germain</hi>'s Succeſſor ſhould not go into <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:153668:26"/> Provided that the King's Confeſſor will name another; I could wiſh that the Dutcheſs would have Ordered a little Note to be writ to the King's Confeſsor about this Matter, and that by an agreeing to his deſires, that the Succeſsor might remain with him ſtill, and not go into <hi>England,</hi> the Dutcheſs might then the better put him in mind of the Merchants of <note n="*" place="margin">Suppoſed to be the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Antwerp;</hi> for the King's Confeſsor does apprehend the mentioning any ſuch thing to the King of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the King having given his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction already to a Miniſter of State, who is at preſent in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> it belongs only to that Miniſter to put this Affair in Execution; for it is the way here, that no Miniſter dare to act in any Matter that is not committed to his Province; for the King will have it ſo. And therefore if the Confeſsor be not preſsed with ſome new Motive, I ſhall hardly be able to make him act. Our old Ambaſsador Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> is arrived in Town, where <hi>St. Germain</hi> now is, he came on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, and <hi>St. Germain</hi> has let me know, that he will ſee him either to Day or to Morrow; which he could not do before, by reaſon of his Calling, which has taken him up without intermiſſion till Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. There is no News yet, but is expected every Moment; The Town of <hi>Ayre</hi> is hard preſsed, and is believed will be ſoon taken. Monſieur <hi>Luxembourgh</hi> is taking Orders that a Proviſion of Oats be ſent to him before he goes to attack the Enemy.</p>

                  <p>YOu will pleaſe Sir with theſe to receive my Thanks for Two of yours, both which came to my hands ſince the departure of the laſt Ordinary. The Proceedings of the Parliament are ſufficiently ſuſpected by the King of <hi>France;</hi> And it were to be wiſh'd, that <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Confederates had not ſo much cauſe to flatter themſelves that the Parliament may at laſt be able to effect any thing of that kind, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

Lord Treaſurer, I fear, is not a Friend to the Catholicks; and yet I am told, That he has lately found the Endeavours of the Duke to have been of great uſe to him. I ſhall not long trouble you with thoſe Affairs; her R. H.

If Lord <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> be Ambaſſador, then Sir <hi>Ellis Leighton</hi> will not be idle; and there may be good uſe made of ſuch an Inſtrument, if the right way be taken.

In the mean time allow me to aſſure you, that <hi>Coleman</hi> has made the beſt Judgment of the Propoſal of Mr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in regard to all Circumſtances, was capable of; neither did <hi>Sheldon</hi> deſign that the old Cloaths ſhould be thrown away till <hi>Spain</hi> proffer'd new ones; That which was chiefly recommended to <hi>Coleman</hi> was, to find out means to ſuggeſt to <hi>Spain</hi> that he ſhould fit the Duke with ſuch a Sute, as is there propos'd, and then perhaps the Dutcheſs's Friend would not refuſe to wear the Livery. <hi>Sheldon</hi> nor Biſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> cannot at this Diſtance make any advance in it; but the latter, who underſtands the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Spain,</hi> thinks that if it were ſuggeſted with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that will enſue, the proffer will come from thoſe of <hi>Spain. France</hi> is not in a Condition to quit his Friends upon meer Suſpitions; on the contrary, they will render them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to him. Here is a Perſon in this Town, that is call'd Sir <hi>Charles Prettyman;</hi> who has Correſpondence with ſeveral Parliament Men, from whom he ſays he is aſſur'd, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Two Houſes is already compos'd, and that they are agreed to enter no more into thoſe Diſputes, but una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly to Endeavour a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and to Unite the King's Subjects in that Deſign, to give Liberty of Conſcience, knowing very well, that then the Papiſts themſelves will be as earneſt againſt the <hi>French</hi> as any others; which I take to be a very reaſonable Judgment. <hi>I</hi> wiſh you could give me ſome aſſurance of this. But let <hi>Coleman</hi> know, that <hi>Sheldon</hi> in this Conjuncture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what may be more for the purpoſe of the Duke and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, than what <hi>Coleman</hi> deſires to know, whether it be the wiſh only of <hi>Sheldon,</hi> and indeed it is only his wiſh; becauſe he cannot tell at this diſtance how to advance any thing towards the ſuggeſting to <hi>Spain</hi> how he might find his Accounts in it, and from that Conviction induce him to proceed; but he hopes that <hi>Coleman</hi> may have Opportunities to do this, and that Effectually; His Reflections are juſt, and comprehend the whole to the full; If this way be not taken, I conceive a languiſhing condition will be the hard Fate of many to whom we wiſh well. The <hi>French</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:153668:29"/> King's Condition is in a decline; you will infer from thence what is neceſſary. When I told you that the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſuſpected, in reference to the Dutcheſs's Friend, I did not intend to ſay poſitively that the Duke was thereupon ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>France;</hi> but that thoſe that belong to the <hi>French</hi> King, did entertain ſome Jealouſies upon it, and that the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> was frequently with the Dutcheſs's Friend, was told me by the Correſpondent of the Duke; who he is, the Bearer of theſe can tell you.</p>
                  <p>I hope to have the Diſpatch for your Three Friends by the next Poſt. If you are ſatisfy'd with the Biſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi>'s and <hi>Sheldon</hi>'s Proceedings, they are at eaſe; but were afraid that things had been ill repreſented to you, ſince thoſe of that Party have been found too blame upon that account, by the next God willing you ſhall have more upon that Subject. I pray God continue and proſper the hopes you give of your Miſtreſs. I am, without reſerve, Yours.</p>

                  <p>I Have yours of the 12<hi>th,</hi> which I had anſwer'd by the laſt Poſt, if I had not ſpent ſo much time in the ſearch of <hi>K.</hi> from whom I expected the Diſpatches for your Shee friends. I am ſorry they are not yet ready, and that you muſt have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience till the return of the Court from <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi> I am glad you are ſatisfy'd with the Biſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi>'s Proceedings; and I deſire you not to apprehend that any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice will fall upon Religion or the Catholicks upon a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of that account, which being now wholly referred to <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt expect ſuch an Iſſue, as ſhall there be determin'd; but they are not uſually too Expeditious in thoſe kind of Diſpatches, and therefore I aſſure my ſelf, it will be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time before you hear any thing more concerning that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Yet becauſe you ſeem to expect to have from me <hi>the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> of what can be ſaid upon it, though I dare not undertake for ſo full an account; yet I ſhall endeavour to give you a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that I ſhall not be wanting to Contribute all that I can to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153668:30"/> your Satisfaction, but I cannot undertake for it by this Poſt, both by reaſon of other Diſpatches, which lye upon my hands, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe my Indiſpoſition of Health which binds me to the obſervance of Phyſical Preſcriptions, and other mournful Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, do take up the greateſt part of my time, and too great a ſhare of my Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Now I muſt Inform you, <q rend="inline">That the immediate Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> did ſend for a Friend of ours, the next in Degree to Lord <hi>Almond,</hi> and deſir'd to know his Opinion of the Project, which the Ambaſsador of <hi>Spain</hi> had laid to draw the King to make War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon told him how it was contriv'd, that the Houſe of Lords and Commons, ſhould upon that Condition furniſh Money, and accommodate the Catholicks; thoſe of <hi>France</hi> ſeeing how far they are from any preſent Capacity of offering ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and how eaſie it is for thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> to procure them, they can ſcarce allow their Fears to prevail above their Hopes after they have rightly weigh'd the Intereſt which Religion has in it. Yet he did not omit to ſay, That the Duke would not deſert <hi>France,</hi> though he could not doubt but that Religion would have the Aſcendant. Your Friend, and my Kinſman Mr. <hi>K.</hi> well known to the Confeſſor of the Duke, and of the ſame Profeſſion, might, methinks, be highly ſerviceable upon this Occaſion, if he would only ſound the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſsador upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and repreſent to him, according as Occaſion ſhall be given, the many and great Advantages which would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the great Dammages that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to <hi>France</hi> upon this account; but to make it efficacious he muſt ſhew the Neceſſity of engaging the Duke and Catholicks in the Concern of it, without which it will never have any ſteady Effect. I need not ſuggeſt to you any farther Conſiderations on this Subject, the Prudence of <hi>Coleman</hi> will direct you, and from thence I ſhall hope to ſee a good Iſſue for the Catholicks. I have not many Diſcourſes with Sir <hi>P.</hi> but he is ſtill of the ſame Opinion as formerly, and affirms, that no other means can effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually conduce to the Satisfaction of the Houſe of Lords and Commons, and thoſe whom they are engaged for.</q> If you ſee no appearance of Succeſs this way, be ſo kind as to ſhew me ſome other Scheme, upon which we may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:153668:30"/> ground any comfortable Expectations. In the mean time we muſt content our ſelves, with ſuch hopes as we are able to furniſh.</p>

                  <p>I Have yours of the 6<hi>th,</hi> and one Weekly from <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Man, for all which I return moſt hearty Thanks; and though it be my Misfortune not to have hitherto ſucceeded in the Pretenſions of our Shee-Friends; yet upon the delivery of the ſecond Memorial, I was promis'd an Infallible Diſpatch this Week, which will coſt me another Journey to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and I hope to ſend it to you by Mr. <hi>Nicholls.</hi> He and his Charge arriv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt late at Night. I was the next Day in Town upon no other Deſign than to meet <hi>Pompone</hi> upon the account of that Buſineſs. <q rend="inline">He told me ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That the Intereſt of the Religion of the Catholicks, was likely to be promoted by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, and the Friends of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> I reply'd, That it was too great an Undertaking, and that it could not take any Effect, eſpecially ſince they did imploy no Endeavours to gain the Duke and his Party to that Intereſt; and though it was reported here that the Duke had frequent Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador; yet I did aſſure, that there were no ſuch Applications made, and that the Duke was as much attack'd to the King of <hi>France</hi> as ever. It would have become Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> to have ſaid this, though he had not been ſo ſure of the Truth of it, as he is by the Information of <hi>Coleman.</hi> The Decline of <hi>Spain;</hi> I confeſs, muſt needs require a long time to regain Power, and that firſt to ſecure his own Intereſt, before he can be in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to promote that of Religion. The hopes on * <hi>Spain</hi>'s ſide, are not ſo remote, and you have rais'd my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation from thence to no low Degree; becauſe <hi>Coleman</hi> feems not only to approve of it, but to think it worth his pains to lay out his Contrivances and Endeavours upon it. I with my Kinſman were engag'd, and poſſibly the opportunity may now be favourable; at leaſt if he will not enter into the Negotiation, he may eaſily introduce</q>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:153668:31"/> 
                     <hi>Coleman,</hi> with thoſe Advantages, as may make him be eſteem'd a fit Inſtrument, and worthy to be truſted in that Concern, and he having ſuch an Introduction, I ſhall not doubt but that he will be able to give a very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Buſineſs. It draws near the 29; but I hope there is yet time enough to diſpoſe things in order to that Deſign. I do not well comprehend how the Danger is over on the part of the Prorogation; unleſs it be in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that Oppoſition of the City of <hi>London.</hi> I ſhould be glad to Promiſe my ſelf that it were in Relation to the Duke; who is ſaid to be the Perſon that obſtructed the Prorogation, and the Procurer of the Parliaments preſent Inſtallation; The Deſign of my Lord Treaſurer, I hope will have no Effect. The Alliance with the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> ſome ſay, is ſought for by the <hi>French</hi> King, for one of the Dukes of <hi>France;</hi> but this is but a gueſs; yet ſuch a one as gives ſuſpition to <hi>Spain,</hi> that there is like to be ſome Clandeſtine doings betwixt <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> But why do I ſo much intrench upon your better Employs? I ſhall only aſſure you, that Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> is your Servant, and that <hi>Coleman</hi> will always find him ſo to his Power.</p>

                     </hi> of <hi>September,</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſeem to intimate that it is almoſt a Month ſince you receiv'd any from me, I have call'd my Self to an Account, and cannot find that I have effectually been ſo much wanting to my own Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as not to continue upon you ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to allow me the Favour of your Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence. I am become ſo miſtruſtful upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, of my own Memory, that I could almoſt perſuade my ſelf to doubt whether I have inform'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:153668:31"/> you of a delay that is caſt upon the Pretenſions of your Shee Friends, which I hope will ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, ſince it only depends upon a Return from <hi>Liſle,</hi> whoſe Magiſtrates were to be conſulted in that Concern; and upon their Anſwer, I hope you will have Satisfaction to the Addreſs which has been made. Have I not likewiſe bemoan'd my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, for having had only a Glimpſe of Mr. <hi>Grey,</hi> having diſappointed each other, by my going to him, and his coming to me, upon the ſame Day? This I do chiefly reſent; becauſe, I ſuppoſe he might have had ſome particular Commiſſion from you, and had not Opportunity to make me partaker of it. The Secretary of Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny,</hi> has inform'd me of your good Correſpondence with his Maſter, which muſt needs render you Suſpected to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador; but I ſhall expect according to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the Iſſue of my Kinſman's Negotiation; <hi>What Meaſures the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſador has taken with the Parliament, a little time will diſcover; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſador ingages the Duke upon the account of the Catholicks, the King of</hi> Spain <hi>will not find his account.</hi> The Duke, I ſuppoſe, has gain'd no ſmall Credit with the Parliament; It is reaſonable to think ſo, if Common Report may be allowed for Truth. What muſt that produce? any Advantage to the Catholicks? Does not the Duke expect to be Re-enſtall'd? Was not that promis'd by thoſe of Prorogation? Are there any Appearances of theſe Expectations from the Parliament?</p>
                  <p>We are here inform'd, That the Parliament deſigns to give Money for the Fleet, upon Condition the King will reduce the Number of the <hi>French</hi> Men
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153668:32"/> of War, to the account which they formerly kept with Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The King here has of late been ill diſpos'd, and ſubject to a little <hi>Vertigo.</hi> He has laid a Tax upon the men of the Roab, which will furniſh a vaſt Sum without any burthen to the People; and he has given out Commiſſions for great Leavies for the next Campaign.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not over-charge you with News, you are better inform'd from other hands. Your Town will ſhortly be the Scene of News, and then I hope you will make me Partaker of the Tranſactions. In the mean time I am,</p>

               <p>And his general manner of Writing was this; he wrote a Letter with ink concerning ſome ordinary trivial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as about Perſons taking Coach to Travel, about the faſhion of wearing Crape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> writing the lines at a pretty broad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, leaving a ſpace between for interlining: In this ſpace, and upon the remaining blank of the Paper, he wrote with <hi>Juice of Lemmon</hi> the Secret Matter which now is here printed.</p>
               <p>The uſe of ſuch Writing was, that if the Letters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, or miſcarried, nothing would appear to the <hi>Caſual Reader</hi> but the frivolous Matter writ in <hi>Ink,</hi> but when they came to the hands of his Correſpondent, he heated them at a fire, and that made the Lemmon Juice appear, and become le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
               <p>But it falls out in this way, that if the Writer do not ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch, he will ſometimes write dry, the juice which was in the Pen being ſpent. Alſo by unwary holding too near the fire the Paper is liable to be ſinged.</p>
               <p>By ſuch accidents there happen to be ſeveral Obliterations, and Blanks and Breaks in theſe Letters; which interrupts the Current of the Diſcourſe in ſome places; and thereby part of this Evidence is loſt.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153668:33"/> Sentiments of Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> were we might gueſs, and how gladly we Would ſee him diſpos'd of as we deſire, but that he thought his medling in it would rather hinder than advance our deſign, however that he was willing to receive directions in it from the Duke, and that he ſhould alwayes be ready to joyn and work with him in any deſign he ſhould judge for the good of that common Trade.</p>

I pray be very cautious there be no ſuſpicion given of any thing of this with you; for the King is very ſcrupulous here, even of ſome of his chiefeſt Miniſters, whom perhaps he may apprehend people have been, or at leaſt have endeavoured to be dealing with. And Father <hi>Ferriere</hi> poſitively charged me to communicate it to no one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but the Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> of whom they have a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

But I prevail'd at laſt that I might do it by you, or Col. <hi>Talbot</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For that being they would not yet let me go my ſelf, it was impoſſible but I muſt employ ſome body, and that I could not elſe write to the Duke, and that I anſwered for you as for my ſelf: To which at laſt they conſented. I intended to have taken the liberty to have wrote to his Highneſs; but this to you I think will do better.

I muſt confeſs <hi>Ravigny</hi> is much ſuſpected by me, and the <hi>French</hi> King's backwardneſs in coming to the point, and other little circumſtances which I obſerve, but cannot ſo well expreſs, makes me believe he had an underhand dealing, which keeps them in ſuſpence. <hi>I told you in my former that if the Duke had power enough upon his own ſtock to carry on the Trade, and compaſs the Parliaments Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that it was my humble Advice, he ſhould do it upon any terms in the world; for that they would be glad to come in Partners, after they ſee it was done upon any advantagious terms to the Duke whatſoever: but if you find you cannot probably do it without two or three hundred thouſand pounds,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:153668:37"/> you muſt reſolve to give ſome body ſome power to make Treaty, back'd with your Athority, and to endeavour to colour the buſineſs, and ſhew them (as on my Soul it is their true Intereſt) what ever Projects other people may have put them on; for they have ſo mean an Opinion of the King, and do ſo little regard his Word or Government, that you cannot imagine how they deſpiſe him, and all the Company: And if the Duke ſhall ſuſpend this too, and not purſue it vigorouſly ſome way or other; that is, endeavour to do it himſelf, if poſsible; if not, uſe ſuch means as are proper to induce them to help them: I ſay, if he does not, I really fear they will judg Sloth and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an Epidemical Diſeaſe; and he tainted with it, as well as the reſt, and conſequently no more to be valued or depended on. I would therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire the Lord</hi> Arundel <hi>and</hi> Coleman <hi>ſeriouſly to conſider and adviſe with the Duke about it. The first, without doubt, if upon his own ſcore and ſtrength, would do his buſineſs in all reſpects: but if that cannot be, we must endeavour to make the best Market we can with the French King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is my Opinion: if it be wrong, correct it, but pardon me.

I hear the Abbot <hi>Rizzini</hi> has writ for him to Mr. <hi>De Puy</hi> and the Counteſs: If it can be compaſſed, I tell you what I ſhall get, let him look to what he ſhall get: Methinks the thing ſhould not be difficult, for help and advice cannot be amiſs; they may chuſe whether they will make uſe of him or no; and they cannot have him at a cheaper rate than for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                     <hi>THrokmorton</hi> was yeſterday to ſpeak with <hi>Pompone,</hi> whom he found allarm'd by <hi>Ruvigni,</hi> for the King's Reſolution about the Parliament; he had told him the greateſt part of the ſtory of the Lord Treaſurer, concerning the Lord <hi>Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> though he ſaid he took <hi>Throckmorton</hi>'s coming to him very kindly, and heard him ſpeak with great attention; which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity <hi>Throckmorton</hi> made the beſt uſe he could of to preſs the thing: he told him, that the Duke had hitherto done his utmoſt endeavours to hinder the Reſolution of the Parliament, and to procure a Diſſolution of it; That he had been in great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French King's Aſſiſtance, in which if he had but contributed in any meaſure, the thing might have been done ſix months ſince. Indeed <hi>Throckmorton</hi> has no orders from the Duke to ask any thing yet; but yet however <hi>Throckmorton</hi> knew the Affairs a little, and that he had great reaſon to believe the Duke would not be able to reſiſt the Parliament any longer, if he were not very ſpeedily aſſiſted by the Fr. King. That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was certainly very oppoſit to both their Intereſts, but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably to that of the French King's; for that, as he had told him before, the Duke, if he would have quitted the Fr. King, might have made good Conditions for himſelf, and ſo he ſhall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153668:39"/> yet when he pleaſes, with the Parliament; but that for the French King he muſt expect no ſuch thing, for that infallibly the Parliament would engage the King, the very firſt moment, to joyn in War with <hi>Spain, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, Holland,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governour in <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt him; that he muſt not judge of the Power of the King's Play now, by what he played for him whilſt the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was Trumps, and therefore, believe it, would not be more againſt him if the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> ſhould continue Trumps with the Parliament; for that I aſſured him it would be moſt powerful, and carried againſt him with great animoſity and heat; as on the other ſide, if Trumps ſhould be changed by the French King's help, and the Duke taken for Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he might promiſe himſelf ſomewhat a warmer and uſefuller Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; that he had made him diſcourſes to this purpoſe heretofore; that he had thought to have quite deſiſted, finding ſo little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fear of being thought importunate; but that the War not now juſt upon new ſhuffling of the Cards, ſhould warn him once more, but that now he had done, for he had diſcharged his Conſcience, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his utmoſt for the Common Good; and if God did not ſee fit to bleſs his endeavours with ſucceſs, he would ſit down quietly, though never contentedly, before that the Catholicks and his Intereſt ſhould be thus abandoned, tho there were no other Intereſt of the Duke's or the French King's in it. And there I began to tickle <hi>Pompone</hi> upon that Point; in which you muſt know he doth much — himſelf. That <hi>Throckmorton</hi> needed not to ſay any more to clear himſelf from any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of private deſigns or intereſts in it, as from impoſing any thing upon them, for that themſelves knew he never did, nor never would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit a ſhilling by them; and that the event of things had always ſhewed them that his Intelligence was right, and his Advice ſound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompone</hi> began to anſwer with a confirmation of the concluſion of his Diſcourſe, and told him that the King had the ſame opinion of him that he could wiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but came to his old [what Remedy?] again: for that <hi>Throckmorton</hi> had asked three, four, or five hundred thouſand pounds; a thing unpoſſible to be compaſſed. <hi>Throckmorton</hi> told him, that was a miſtake, for that half of the latter, perhaps, might do it; and then told him the ſubſtance of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letter of the 21th paſt, as to time, and other circumſtances too: but <hi>Throckmorton</hi> told him, that after all this, if there were 500000 <hi>l.</hi> or double, whether he thought in his conſcience it were any better parting with it for the French King, than to have the Parliament joyn with <hi>Holland, &amp;c.</hi> And whether he believed that double and treble that would not ſoon be ſet flying, in caſe of a War, ſuppoſing theſe circumſtances? Then he cryed, <hi>Huy par Dieu.</hi> Then, Sir, ſaid the other, Look to it, for it will certainly be. Then he came to it again, and ſaid, that the Duke ſaid to <hi>Ruvigni,</hi> that notwithſtanding he always told him the King had ſaid free and friendly things on the French King's
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153668:40"/> behalf. I anſwered, as you may gueſs, to that; but ſuſpecting by all this, that <hi>Ruvigni</hi> might be his Creature, and that he was afraid he might be excluded in this buſineſs, <hi>Throckmorton</hi> told him, you may imagin, that I bear <hi>Ruvigni</hi> no good will. I proteſt to you the contrary; and to ſhew you how little that is in my thoughts, tho I muſt confeſs I think I could put them in a ſhorter way of doing it; Give <hi>Ruvigny</hi> but a ſufficient Power to do it, and a ſtrict Command to execute it, and I deſire never to know it, nor will I trouble you any more to enquire after it; and ſhall think my ſelf ſufficiently happy if I have in any wiſe forwarded the thing for the doing of it effectually, which is the only aim I have, and therefore cared not by whom it was done. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

This is all <hi>Throckmorton</hi> could do. And if they are blind or mad, you muſt have patience. But ſure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they will do, and let it be what it will, or how it will, if the Duke can do his buſineſs by it, pray let him not reject it. His turning 300000 <hi>l.</hi> into 400000, makes me believe they intend to do ſomething. I muſt confeſs I ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed to ſee it to confirm the Duke: for if he give ground, <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament have no bounds — You muſt imagine <hi>Throckmorton</hi> enlarged upon theſe heads. They had ſome diſcourſe of <hi>Coleman</hi> too, who <hi>Pompone</hi> ſaid he heard was a Man of Parts, <hi>&amp;c. Throckmorton</hi> replied to that, what I think he could have wiſhed himſelf had been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I had yours of the 25th juſt now: If you cannot reade mine better than I do yours, which is ſoil'd one half, your Paper blots ſo, I do not wonder that you underſtand not what I would have you get <hi>Ruvigny</hi> to write. I would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than what he hath done.

                  <p>The King's Factor is much diſcontented againſt <hi>Pompone, Louvoy,</hi> and in fine all the reſt. He gave me yeſterday great ſigns of it, and pretty touches too againſt Duke <hi>Lauderdale.</hi> The French King hath cleared the buſineſs again with <hi>Sueden,</hi> and they are reſolved again to act, you know (I ſuppoſe) what — rub in the way.

How this may work as to ſome other Affairs you know of, I cannot tell; but I think, however, this ſhould be no hindrance. <hi>Adieu.</hi> I am almoſt tired to death.

I have in the interim written pretty full to Mr. <hi>Hayes</hi> (at my Brothers as you know) to conferre with you, what my time is too ſhort to repeat about the old buſineſs, in which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> would get the Queen to give Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> his place to a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> under ſeveral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretexts, as ſome of your Friends give out here, will ſpeedily be done; and if the King had not at firſt hindered, would have been done by the Queen.

In the ſame

I wonder Mr. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> maketh ſo much Noiſe in that affair alſo, having had no ſuch Commiſſion to trouble himſelf or others in it, and if (as you ſay) he came thither chiefly about that buſineſs, he might more quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as wiſe, and to as much purpoſe as he came; thus much in ſhort to your two firſt and two laſt which contain the ſame: And let the Duke be aſſured Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> will ſerve him and all the Catholicks whether they will or no, although the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> and his Friends are enough to enflame all, if their Malice were not well known at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by Cardinal <hi>Altieri, Fra. Barberin,</hi> and many others; But I dare anſwer Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> is of no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but againſt the Factious, who are in great number but cannot prevail <hi>in iniquitatibus ſuis.</hi> The Secretary of the Dutcheſſes Cypher is not large enough, beſides hath not the Alphabetical Letters (neceſſary
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153668:45"/> to make words) and I find ſome numbers in his Letters which are not in the Cypher, pray deſire him to amplify it accordingly. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> wrote hither to Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> a very fooliſh, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inalieious Letter againſt Cardinal <hi>Fra. Barberin,</hi> as he hath often other ſuch like and worſe ones to others of manifeſt falſities, which I my ſelf have ſeen and have actually, written by his own hand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his forging falſe Letters is a conſtant old Cuſtom of his. I will ſay no more at preſent, leſt I ſhould ſay too much; but this I dare ſay, that if the Duke make uſe of him or ſhew him his Favour, he will much diſgrace himſelf and his Cauſe, and put both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks in great Diviſion, which will be the eaſieſt way for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to deſtroy them, and every one wonders how Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> ſhould be of late ſo great a Protector and Friend of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> when to my knowledge (and many others) he was quite the contrary (as he told me) not long before the Arch-Biſhop pretending to Mr. <hi>Sheldons</hi> place about the Dutcheſs, but it appeareth that Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> and his Confederates by their late violent bending for the Arch-Biſhop and his ways againſt the other is more out of Faction than Zeal: However let not the Duke be troubled, Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> will take care all be done according to Juſtice, let it be for whom it will, <hi>Fiat Juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>a &amp; pereat Mundus.</hi> But now I muſt tell you, I cannot but be ſorry to underſtand (by Witneſſes which I can produce) that ſome chief of Mr. <hi>Sheldons</hi> Confederates have informed that the Dukes affection is ſo much and only for thoſe and the Confederates of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Confeſſor, That he abſolutely declared it, and ſaid he would be ſerved by them only, which if ſo <hi>Vincent de Torre,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Norfolks</hi> Confederates may ſhut up their Shop and Traffique elſewhere, and I ſhould be glad to know it, to provide accordingly, for although it is moſt clear and true what I ſaid often in <hi>England,</hi> That if Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> had not ſent <hi>Fa. White</hi> in Poſt haſte from <hi>Rome</hi> where the Dutcheſs was then, and that he and another of his Confederates had not ſtoutly reſiſted and concluſively argued againſt the Potent confrater of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Confeſſor, with the Dutcheſs, that that Dutcheſs and none elſe as th'other would have, (to put off the concluding of this Dutcheſs) was fitting, and to be had for the Duke, the whole buſineſs (which was then broken off) would have been ſpoiled and broken off for ever; But Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from <hi>Paras</hi> at firſt of the breaking off of the other Treaty, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend of his there thought firſt of that Dutcheſs which (God be praiſed) is, and ſpoke to Lord <hi>Peterb.</hi> of it. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (of all which the ſaid Lord <hi>Peterb.</hi> can tell you) and at the ſame time Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> wrote to ſeveral at <hi>Rome</hi> about it, and poſted the above-named Fa. <hi>White</hi> with full Inſtructions to employ all his little Wits and thoſe of his Confederates (whoſe Houſe joyneth to that of the Dutcheſs) to act all poſſible, as they did to the right purpoſe, and (<hi>nolens volens</hi> the juggling of others,) argued ſo hotly and well that it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded quite contrary to the intention and expectation of the Juggler's; My Lord <hi>Peterb.</hi> can tell you ſomething of it, and I can much more; but ſince the buſineſs is done its no matter, I did it not to pick thanks, or for recompence to me or mine, but to ſerve the Duke and Catholick
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153668:45"/> Religion in <hi>England,</hi> yet I muſt tell you that not only Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but his alſo are as able to ſerve the Duke and Catholick Religion in <hi>England</hi> as any whoſoever, and both are in a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and eſteem with the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> and General all of his ſort, and at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> than any whoever, and if the Pope live ſome conſiderable time (as its likely) he will make a third like Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> alive in great Eſteem, Birth, VVorth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will ſay no more, but as Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> hath ſerved the Duke long ſince in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>England</hi> when he leaſt thought of it, and yet knoweth not of, ſo as he did it meetly out of Affection and Duty, he will in all times and places he can continue the ſame. Yet Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> is not ignorant of many ill Offices ſeveral others (whom God forgive) endeavoured to do Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> with the Duke and Dutcheſs, and alſo with the King and Queen for their factious ends; however <hi>Qui ambulat ſimpliciter, ambulat confidenter,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> always did, thoſe malicious endeavours being but ſmall Flea-bitings, although they endeavoured the like alſo with the Pope, Cardinal <hi>Altieri, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barin,</hi> and all others they could at <hi>Rome, ſed nihil occulium quod non reveletur,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> had ſufficient notice in <hi>England</hi> of all, and now a more ample; but I will ever go the old ſtreight way with the <hi>Pater noster</hi> of <hi>demitte nobis debita noſtra ſicut &amp; nos dimittimus debitoribus noſtris,</hi> which I do with all my heart, continuing with that other old Prayer of <hi>demitte illis Domine quia neſeiunt quid faciunt, &amp; ſic finitur.</hi> But unto the other part of this point. I muſt again take leave to tell you, That it may do the Duke no ſmall prejudice, if the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> or the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> with his Confederates of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be perſwaded of the Dukes partiallity to any whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: He may be a good Friend to any in general or particular <hi>(amicus Plato ſed magis tamen amica veritas)</hi> but partial to none, ſo far as to the excluſion of others; Pray Sir, excuſe my freedom, which poſteth my Pen beyond my firſt intention, whilſt <hi>ex abundantia cordis os lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur,</hi> and let it not be that <hi>veritas odium parit,</hi> my intention is good whatever the effects may prove. Finally, <hi>Liberavi animam mcam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Sir, <hi>ad hominem (quia fragites ſumus)</hi> excuſe Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s humanity, which muſt be mentioned whilſt in this Valley of miſery, as becometh an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, for the reputation at leaſt of the King, Queen, Duke, Dutcheſs and the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> if any of them have a true ſenſe thereof, if not <hi>v deant ipſi</hi> the fault, and ſhame will ly at their Door, and damage not Cardinal <hi>Norfolk's,</hi> who will however be well able to do his Duty <hi>coram Deo &amp; hominibus;</hi> Is it not a ſhame for them all to thruſt Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> totally on the Pope and <hi>Rome,</hi> who have already <hi>motu proprio</hi> done ſo much, beyond all imaginable expectation? nay, is it not worſe that the King others, ſhould endeavour to thruſt Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> on <hi>France, Spain</hi> or the Emperour, by moſt whereof Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> has ſeveral years ſince had great offers, but would never bite at, and ſince made Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> more powerful offered. But if the King and the reſt Judge him not worthy of wearing his own Maſters Livery, he will rather appear ſo naked as yet to cover <hi>pudicitiam patris (ſive patriae) ſui</hi> with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153668:46"/> his own ſimple Coat, rather than Embroider it with others Livery, to appear like a Baſtard of his <hi>ingratae Patria.</hi> To obviate which, I propoſed laſt week to Monſieur <hi>Vincent Torre,</hi> an old expedient, I had heretofore thought of, for another good end, and was of late practiſed for another purpoſe; but reflecting ſince that not only <hi>Qui cito dat, bis dat,</hi> but that thoſe who efficaciouſly intend only to give good words and future contingencies, on which <hi>non datur ſcientia &amp; quae nihil ponunt in re,</hi> will ſo put off things of Execution, and always create or find difficulties, inſomuch that nothing is effected.</p>
                  <p>To avoid this therefore, and better clear all, I have bethought my ſelf of another more facile expedient, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the King will at once conſider Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> it may be thus: To Grant a Barrony unto ſuch a one, whom he may name, of Worth, Eſtate, Fidelity, Deſert, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> may lawfully get a pretty Summ of Money, and of the reſt, in due time, farther Conſideration may be had; This the Duke can beſt manage, neither will it be a new wonder, or <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> although it ſhould be even for a Catholick, more than when the King would have made Sir <hi>Francis Ratcliffe</hi> what you know (which was more) on the ſcore, you know, I ſhall need ſay no more, <hi>Quia ſapienti &amp; intell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>genti pauca.</hi> If the King pleaſe to do it, and the Duke pleaſe to Act the requeſt and perfectioning of it with ſpeed, Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> will gratefully acknowledge it accordingly, but if it be put off until better or worſe times of <hi>futuris con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingentibus,</hi> I can although not Scientifically, Prophetically (not as a Prophet, but as an &amp;c.) gueſs it at an end, and will no longer caſt my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>THIS Week we have no Letters by way of <hi>Flanders</hi> from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lect. pro Rege.</note> the <hi>French</hi> having intercepted them, as we are told; Sir <hi>Hen. Tich.</hi> is gone away hence towards <hi>France,</hi> and ſo for your Quarters. The very morning early before he went hence, I procured him a private Diſcourſe with my Father here, in which he was much ſatisfied, and will bring my Fathers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular recommendations to the Duke and Dutcheſs, although (as Sir <hi>Hen.</hi> wrote to you ſometime ſince,) at <hi>Rome</hi> they wonder the Dutcheſs writeth not to the Pope, which when Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> was firſt told of, he could hardly believe, being thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtand much on thoſe Punctilio's, as you know, eſpecially that the Dutcheſs being of that Country, either the Dutcheſs or other about her ſhould remember her to do it, it being ſo eaſy a thing, nay, and on the matter a Duty, wherefore if it be not yet done, I pray haſten it hither, and I will preſent it with the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing Complements I can, for here they have a Good will for the Dutcheſs and the Duke, as they ſay, they ſhewed to both in the Diſpenſ. which the Pope granted to the Dutcheſs to be with the Duke, as they are, although you know it was denyed to the Dutcheſs when ſhe was in her own Countrey which denyal they ſay, was not on any ill will to the Dutcheſs or the Duke, but quite on the contrary, for both their good (the Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before exhorted the Dutcheſs unto it) but on other reaſons which I ſuppoſe you know, as alſo becauſe the Pope was not fully ſatisfied of the Dukes being a Catholick; which if ſo, there would have been no need of the Popes Diſpenſ. nay, that which then gave him doubt of the Dukes being a Catholick, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153668:47"/> which yet doth not at all ſatisfie the Pope, or at <hi>Rome</hi> is the Duke doing as (they eſteem it) the contrary, by going (as you know) with the Proteſtants, which you know was long ſince condemned by former Popes, that the Catholicks could not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in that point I confeſs I was put to my Trumps in <hi>Rome,</hi> when it was objected to me, although I muſt as duly confeſs, it was never yet my Opinion in <hi>England</hi> that any Catholick could do it, and ſo I did clearly declare my ſelf, when, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I thought I ought, or that it was asked me, but I was informed, not long before I left <hi>England,</hi> that otherwiſe people propoſed ſomething confuſedly (not to term it otherwiſe) to ſome whom they thought convenient, to pick out in order to ſay ſomething to that purpoſe, <hi>naſcitur rediculus mus;</hi> and ſo went on, as before, hand over head, it being well for me not to have been called to ſo wiſe a buſineſs, ſince they and others knew I was not wiſe enough to underſtand, being I did never love to go head-long in a buſineſs above my low Capacity, nor endeavour to run hand over head, before I can well go on my own Leggs, much leſs on others Shoulders. Finally, I think I could talk a great deal more Non-ſence on this, than is fitting to be written, it being more excuſable, when <hi>ex abundantia cordis os loquitur;</hi> then when <hi>ex ſtultitia manu ſcribitur;</hi> I would howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſay and write, that hitherto I cannot perceive the right way hath been taken for the Duke and <hi>Rome</hi> to underſtand throughly one another, nor the Catholicks and the Pope nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by confuſed, undigeſted (and too often Factious) No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which will never do rightly the Catholicks of <hi>Englands</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: The Pope doth not at all deſire the Duke to do any thing indiſcreetly, or precipitantly, that all <hi>England</hi> may open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, The Duke is a Catholick, leaving that unto his own diſcretion for a due time: but to do any thing to the contrary, as <hi>Rome</hi> thinketh <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> the Pope cannot approve of; I have however (I am ſure) done my part with <hi>Rome</hi> for the Duke, who is not ſo much to be blamed on his ſide, if others who ſhould know more do not condemn, but rather approve, or at leaſt connive therein. But of all this, and ſomewhat more, more hereafter: Interim, as to what you mention of a 100000 Crowns or more from <hi>Rome</hi> for the Duke is a <hi>Noli me tange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e</hi> at preſent; which the very fear of ſo conſiderable a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo hard to be gotten, would frighten <hi>Rome:</hi> In order to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more eaſy things for the Duke and Catholicks, we muſt firſt clear other ſmall ſtumbling Blocks, leaſt we run on Precipices not ſo eaſily to be gotten off; and I hope all will do well, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Rome</hi> remembers, and ſpeaks often, how in laſt Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> time, another Pope was deceived of much more than a 100000 Crowns, under pretence of the Catholicks in <hi>Ireland;</hi> However as I wrote unto you before, I am not out of hopes in ſome time to get a Penſion for the Dutcheſſes Secretary, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153668:47"/> all Affairs here muſt be well matured firſt, and a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betwixt the Duke and the Pope, and Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> and Rome: For although I aſſure you, That both the Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri</hi> have a particular Eſteem for the Duke that muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and well modelled, that if he come to need it, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Norfolk</hi> may the better endeavour it: And, for this purpoſe I think it not amiſs, to tell you. That Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> had ſome days ſince a Letter, of the one and thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> leſt at his Lodging, from the Duke, by I know not who, yet he called himſelf the Duke's Agent; and, by what Cardinal <hi>Norfolks</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant tells me, He ſeemeth to be an Italian, as it's moſt probable; for, if he were of <hi>England,</hi> I think, he would not ſo publickly give himſelf that Name, which can do the Duke no good at preſent to be called ſo in <hi>Rome</hi> publickly: Although I think it were very fitting, the Duke ſhould have a good one; and, if he like of it, Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> offers him who uſeth to write to you; Mr. <hi>J. Lay;</hi> for whoſe Ability, Fidelity and Activity, Cardinal <hi>Nortolk</hi> will anſwer, and, what he cannot doe, Cardinal <hi>Norfolk</hi> will ſupply, and this without taking the name of it or any Intereſt, which, certainly others would expect, and perhaps want; but he doth neither. This you may offer the Duke in Cardinal <hi>Norfolks</hi> and his name.</p>
                  <p>Here it is ſaid, The Empreſs is not like to live; if ſo, why might it not be thought of matching the Eldeſt of our Princeſſes there, or, if not, <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am much obliged to the Duke and Dutcheſs for Endeavours, if need be, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſhould think of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Cardinal <hi>Norfolk:</hi> But, by what I hear from the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe and others, I think there is no ſuch Intent: It ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been onely the Invention and malicious Reports of ſome; however my Obligation to the Duke, Dutcheſs and Secretary is the ſame. I wrote of late by Sir <hi>He—</hi> to the Duke and Dutcheſs, and unto the Secretary, not long before; unto which I remit my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>I Receive together your two of <hi>Friday</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> and Munday the 10<hi>th April,</hi> being much rejoyced the Duke doth ſo well, not doubting of Gods bleſſing, but if the Duke or Dutcheſs employ the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or his Adherents in <hi>Rome,</hi> it will but confound their and the Catholicks affairs with chymerical Viſions, which at <hi>Rome</hi> are not eſteemed more than to ſpoile real affairs. Neither will <hi>Rome</hi> eſteem a <hi>Benedictine</hi> coming on ſuch things as belong not properly to his Trade. But ſuppoſe his buſineſs is to get a little Money for himſelf, which is not ſo eaſily parted withall, and as to Prince <hi>Rinaldi</hi>'s affair, Cardinal <hi>Norfolke</hi> hath twice (although no body ever ſpoke to him of it) ſpoken earneſtly about, but as affairs ſtand, nothing can at preſent be done for many Reaſons, and you may be ſure that Card. <hi>Fr. Barberine,</hi> who hath ſo long endeavoured it, and the Dutcheſſes Mother now at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Card. <hi>Norfolk,</hi> will do their beſt when a fitting time and occaſion will be, without others, fooliſh impertinent buſie-bodies; and as to the A. B. of <hi>Dublins</hi> prevailing with the Duke in his late Reſolution, few or none will believe it here, he being ſo uſed to write falſhoods and forgeries, that his ſaying it maketh it not believed, but if it were ſo, <hi>de bono opere non lapidamus te.</hi> He did his duty, for which God recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him. And as to what Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> pretends to ſay in the other point, betwixt the A. B. of <hi>Dublin</hi> and his adverſary, <hi>Rome</hi> needeth not ſuch learned wits, to teach thoſe who know better, others have already as fooliſhly been fidling, but neither Fidler or Fidleſtick is regarded. They may teach fools to dance if they can, for that Tune ſoundeth not right where a better is uſed. The beſt employment Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> can for the Duke and Dutcheſs is to become a <hi>Benedictine,</hi> and pray for them quietly, whileſt having nothing elſe to trouble you withall at preſent I am,</p>

                  <p>A Although I receive yours duely, yet I unwillingly trouble you with my empty Letters, having nothing hence worth your knowledge, but as before, that whatſoever I can with the <hi>Pope</hi> for Prin. <hi>Rinaldi</hi> being a Cardinal I ſhall do my beſt in, and I am glad the Dutcheſs will write to the <hi>Pope</hi> which if ever before done, it's a wonder it was not delivered, as Card. <hi>Alteri</hi> (who ſhould know) tells me, but when this cometh I will deliver it, and tell both how the Dutcheſs ſuppoſed hitherto a former was. Your Correſpondent will be ready to obey the Dukes commands when he ſhall be honoured with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153668:49"/> them, and certainly hath good abilities for it. The new invented re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a Biſhop for <hi>England</hi> are Chymera's; that having long ſince been diſpoſed of, although the <hi>Benedictines</hi> and others played the fools to ſtop the Execution of it in <hi>England</hi> when it was, not intended to be made uſe of but in due time, which others (at leaſt as good as the <hi>Benedictines</hi> and the <hi>Caballers</hi>) ought to judge, and when due time will be, the ſame party <hi>per ſe vel per alium, vel alios,</hi> may do what will be to be done, for ſince the <hi>Benedectines</hi> could not get to be a Biſhop they would have two Biſhops in hopes to be the one, which would be <hi>altare contra altare,</hi> as in <hi>Ireland</hi> betwixt <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> but would be ever <hi>pejor priore,</hi> ſo that they may ſet their Minds and Tongues at reſt, and look well to what is committed to them.

                  <p>I Found in one of your laſt Letters to Mr. <hi>Grane,</hi> a deſire of more punctual Correſpondence from me then Ordinary whilſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave ſitteth: This deſire ſhall be complyed with, ſo far as it is poſſible for me, but I fear your Curioſity will not thereby remain fully ſatisfied; thoſe within the Conclave, who look more religiouſly upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153668:50"/> their Obligation, keeping their ſecrets to themſelves; And amongſt the great variety of reports which fly abroad, it is not eaſy to diſtinguiſh truth from falſhood. I ſhall therefore be ſparing in delivery of ſuch particulars, leaving you to the publick fame, which in the Caſe may upon the matter be relyed upon as well as the intelligence of thoſe who pretend to have the beſt information. You will find here the liſt of the Cardinals which you deſire, ranged under their ſeveral parties or heads, but the order of their promotions is not exactly obſerved, eſpecially in the Creatures of <hi>Altieri</hi> and <hi>Urſini,</hi> (who before the other of the ſame name dyed was called S. <hi>Siſto</hi>) ſhould be in the fourth place and <hi>Baladonne</hi> in the 9<hi>th.</hi> There may be other pretenders to the <hi>Papacy</hi> beſides theſe which are mentioned; But I mark thoſe which are moſt remarkable. Card. <hi>Norfolk</hi> hath received Letters from the King and Duke, enjoyning his adherence with <hi>France,</hi> which he anſwereth by this Poſt, that to the Duke the Secretary of the Durcheſs will ſee. I refer you to other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to what I have writ unto my Lord <hi>Arundell;</hi> and Card. <hi>Norfolk</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hayd.</hi> Card. <hi>Norfolk</hi> will not except the offer from <hi>France</hi> of <hi>Albi,</hi> dreading the dependence which would follow. A like offer from <hi>Spain</hi> hath been refuſed; Many are of opinion the Conclave will laſt long, eſpecially if the <hi>French</hi> perſiſt in their animoſity againſt <hi>Altieri,</hi> who will be able in ſpight of them to hinder the Election of any whom they would endeavour to have choſen without his concurrence. It would be a great ſervice to the Church if this quarrel (which ſeems to have no deep bottom) were taken up; The preſent conjuncture ſeems moſt proper for it, and Card. <hi>Norfolk</hi> might be a proper inſtrument. I hear our Country-man the Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk</hi> hath his health well in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, and gains much in the opinion of his Brethren.

Cardinal <hi>Odeſchelechi</hi> is the perſon on whom the great lot is fallen, by an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of the Electors, and who was deſigned before by a general deſire of the people; the two great Catholick Monarchs concurring likewiſe in the Election, by their approbation of it, we have reaſon to promiſe our ſelves that great matters will be done in his Pontificalte, for the advancement of Catholick Religion.

                  <p>YOu will not wonder at my ſeldom Writing, if you conſider how little there occurs here to write of. Mr. <hi>Gr.</hi> deſires me to render you his thanks for your weekly favours, and to let you know that the Letter which the Duke wrote to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and which was given to Mr. <hi>Con,</hi> hath miſcarried: The Nunce at <hi>Paris</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to have received of Mr. <hi>Con</hi> the Pacquet in which it was, and doth ſay he ſent it hither, but here it cannot be found. The Card. of <hi>Norfolk</hi> hath made this known to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cibo,</hi> who ſays the only remedy now is a Duplicat. I can give you no news hence worth your knowledge; Affairs at the Pallace go on in their flow train. <hi>Monſieur di Luca</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Auditor and Favorite hath theſe days paſt been at death's door, but now there is hope of his recovery. The common ſpeech is, that his Holineſs will ſhortly call to Town ſome of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and confer Honours on them without Salaries. It is alſo ſaid there may probably be a Promotion of Cardinals about <hi>whitſuntide,</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more uncertain here than reports of this nature. Foreign oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences are the great matter of Diſcourſe, in which how much our wiſe men miſtake, you may gueſs by a report, which ſome principal
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:153668:51"/> perſons were Authors of laſt week, and which upon their credit was much believed, <hi>viz.</hi> That his R. Highneſs was in very few days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in <hi>Florence,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Bern. Gaſcoyn</hi> by the great Dukes Order was gone to receive him at the Frontiers of that State. Some other paſſages concerning <hi>England,</hi> directly contrary to truth have been aſſured with great confidence, and accordingly believed. The <hi>Pope</hi> hath lately diſtributed ſome ſmall Penſions to the Cardinals of the laſt promotion, not ſufficiently provided for by his Predeceſſor. The C. of <hi>Norfolk</hi> hath (as I hear) for his ſhare 1600 Crowns, part whereof is to expire at the end of 6 Years, according to the ſtile of Penſions given upon Benefices in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> This help is thought by thoſe who know his Condition, to have but ſmall proportion with his neceſſities. But in this interreſſed Country, and thrifty Pontificat, any little Proviſion of this kind is thought conſiderable. I wiſh you all happineſs and remain,</p>

                  <p>The hope you give that Mr. <hi>Platt</hi> will be recalled is very welcome to the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> There is great need of it, for the Inquiſition hath already begun to ſtir in it. Card. <hi>Cibo</hi> hath made complaint of it to the Reſident of <hi>Florence,</hi> as I have ſignified more particularly to Lord <hi>Arundell.</hi> I long for your next which becauſe it promiſeth much, which ſtraitneſs of time made you omit in the laſt.</p>

                  <p>What hath come to your mind concerning a Match with the Prince of <hi>Florence,</hi> and our Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> deſerves better reffections then I am able for the preſent to make of it; ſetting aſide the intereſt which might move the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> to deſire it. I am verily perſwaded that the great reſpect he hath for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> would ſet a great weight upon his Inclination to carry him towards it; I had yeſterday a Letter from the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> who continues his preſſing earneſtneſs for compaſſing the buſineſs which hath been ſo often mentioned. I doubt it may linger a great while if ſuch a reaſon be expected as may ſatisfy the Enemies of Religion. I think it might ſuffice to alledge, that Mr. <hi>Platt</hi> is very unwelcome to the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi>

                  <p>I Have received yours dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 28th. and if your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pleaſeth with Confidence to retaine me in her Cauſe, as you ſay ſhe will, ſhe may reſt moſt ſecure to be both Faithfully and Uncorruptibly ſerved, according to the old Engliſh Oath of an Attorney, without Fear, Favour, or Affection; from hence therefore I reſolve not to ſtir, upon no other bodies Call nor Fees, untill I have her ſpecial Command to come up to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and full Inſtructions how to move when I am there, which muſt be your part to ſee done and prepared in the mean time, becauſe I would think a little thereupon between this and then, ſince the impertinenteſt of officiouſneſſes is to pretend to be wiſer in other folks concerns than they are themſelves; yet give leave to ſay that I doubt very much words will not be kept with her by thoſe whom chiefly ſhe doth depend on, not to ſhrink in the day of Battle, when bullets begin to fly thick and near; and though my Brother Attorney of <hi>Dorcheſt.</hi> and his whole packed jury ſaving two of the number, who are my Couſin Germains originally, are Cowards, let not that comfort you at all, for if you remember after <hi>Clinias</hi> was driven into the water, he fought like a lyon; beſides, the ills which they have already done, to ſpeak the plain truth, cannot be ſafe but by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting greater, wherein the Ladies Neece if good care be not early taken will have a conſiderable portion.</p>
                  <p>I would you ſaw as I doe becauſe of my Ladies former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure towards me, which makes them lie at ſomething an opener Garde with me in this particular then they doe perhaps with others of the ſame profeſſion, what poſtings, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there are up and down the Country about this matter, to the exaltation of the Neece, <hi>uſ<expan>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153668:53"/> comes to the touch, you'l ſee that it will not abide the tryall nor bear water.</p>
                  <p>The giving of mony then is all I can apprehend to be dangerous in this Caſe, with a Condition to exclude the Aunt out of the entaile, becauſe upon thoſe terms no <hi>ſeparate proviſo</hi> can ſerve her turn, onely conduce towards the invalidating the teſtimony of her witneſſes and Friends.</p>
                  <p>I deſire to here onely that you have gotten this note ſafe into your hands, ſhew it unto my Lady at ſeaſonable opportunities, and ever eſteem me without welt or guard</p>

                  <p>I Have Received yours dated the 13th. of this month, theſe come to you by a ſecure hand, elſe I would not venture to write out of paraboles.</p>
                  <p>The new Parliament is that which the Dorſetſhire Attorney, and all his Clients have now in chace, Conſultations are on foot how to frame addreſſes for it, within the compaſs of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Tell our Lady from me that ſhe hath but one point ſeriouſly to intend, which is to make herſelf, and not be denyed the Commiſſion, mediatrix of the Peace, which <hi>France</hi> as well as <hi>Spain</hi> are more inclined towards than ever, becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs of the German Confederates, for ſhould either the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> or my Lord of <hi>Arlington</hi> get that Employment from her, nay any one beſides, there is an end of her ſtorie: By reaſon if the new Parliament cannot be obtained, to have their own Creatures truſted with this mediation, is the onely hope they have left; I mean the wife of <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> could they and their adherents be authours of the general peace upon the nick of this Conjuncture, I am afraid <hi>France</hi> will not ſtick ſo cloſe to the Lady, as perchance ſhe believeth they would, ſince to my knowledg they are actually in treatie at preſent with thoſe two perſons whom I laſt named to this very purpoſe, therefore you ſee in this cauſe I do not juggle nor regard either pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153668:54"/> Intereſts, or friendſhip: for the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> till he be at the brink of death, will never be right to our Cauſe more, both becauſe he doth think the Lady underhand hath uſed him hardly in the matter of his late perſecutions, as alſo, that moſt of our perſuaſion were in the contrivance of the petition which was delivered in Parliament againſt my Lady of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and him, though perhaps both equally miſtaken, however, I muſt be ſincere always with you, for ſo it is, and if my Lord of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> can obtain the Commiſſion aforeſaid, then a rope for the Pope, and long live the houſe of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> you ſee clearly I truſt you, therefore I am ſure you will not ſuffer the integrity of a poor Country Cloathier to be abuſed.</p>
                  <p>I tell you again, if they can get the acting of the Peace into their hands, in one word, they will be able to doe their work, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actum agere,</hi> and much better hilted than it was the laſt time, for ſo will they be Maſters of the Caſe of all Subſidies, both abroad and at home, which you cannot be ignorant ſomewhere is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent argument; but to thoſe who look aſquint upon things and men that are above their reach, theſe I eaſily believe will be held Chimerical Speculations.</p>
                  <p>Should the matter be ordered ſo as to make the new Parliament the Cauſe of the Peace, or the Peace the means of the new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our Lady may when ſhe pleaſeth retire to hunt at her hired houſe in <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that I deſire from you is to let me know, as ſoon as you can, whether or no this Parliament ſhall meet and ſit again the 13th. of <hi>April,</hi> for the reſt I can better inform you of, than you me, in relation to Country tranſactions.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, nothing can ſave us but reſolution, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the maſque, ſince none but children can be ſo weak as to imagine they are not known through a vizzard, as much as without one on their Faces. My notes are ready, and tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to be ſent you, let the Lady conſider them, and diſpoſe thereof as ſhe thinks good; for 'tis a maxime I ſhall never quit, not to pretend to be wiſer in other folks matters than they are themſelves. I beſeech you burn theſe after our Lady hath ſeen them, I ſhall be very impatient till I am ſure they are ſafe come to your hands, farewell.</p>
                  <p>When I ſay Reſolution, do not think I expect Impoſſibilities, <hi>Deus non coget ad impoſſibilia,</hi> nor am Ignorant how difficult it will be to get that herb out of a Garden, where nothing but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution groweth.</p>

H. My Lord Treaſurer, nor the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> knew any thing of this Myſterious Journey, and then you may be ſure it cannot be good, but thus much I can write upon certain knowledg, that their Emiſſaries do go up and down from Country to Country, to ſettle the minds of the people, that the Parliament will infallibly Sit, and meet in <hi>April</hi> again, and for an earneſt token thereof do give them inſtance by the ſuddain renewing of the order for prohibiting of Papiſts from coming to Court, for out of whoſe quiver that came I need not tell you, only this I can tell you, that ſince he is Canonized not only for the beſt Stateſman, but alſo for the beſt Proteſtant that ever was in <hi>England</hi> ſince my Lord of <hi>Clarendan</hi>'s departure, you ſay we ſhall ſee ſomething about the latter end of the Term, I pray God heartily that the Lady do not too often take nothing for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet am not ignorant of the difficulties ſhe laboureth under neither, by my former Letters which I wrote unto you touching the matter of the Peace, I ſtill intimated that if the Commiſſion to treat it were taken out of her hands there was an end of the ſtory, for if this Parliament doth ever meet again, good night, but ſtanders by cannot underſtand the courſe of the Cards ſo well as thoſe that play them, therefore will I ſay no more of this particuler, though I be ſtrongly perſuaded within my ſelf, that the Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was reſolved only to try to make the better bargain for the ruin of us all, which if it can be effected, remember I tell you let thoſe whom ſhe moſt dependeth upon without naming any body, promiſe never ſo deeply to the contrary, ſhe will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted

                  <p>IT is my duty the Lady ſhould know all things which come to me whatever they are, conſiderable or not, to judge, and make what uſe of them ſhe thinks beſt.</p>
                  <p>Here was with me laſt night one of the Caball and a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who ſaith he can propoſe the greateſt matters unto her imaginable in order to her preſervation and no leſs, in caſe the Parliament doth meet but with this reſtriction to me, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſervice ſtinks, it is a vain time, and the preſent ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs makes moſt men more preſumptious and vain than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would perhaps be.</p>
                  <p>His Propoſals conſiſt but of two Parts, the one to obtain a <hi>proviſo</hi> of Exemption for her in the grand intended Bill againſt Popery, and the other by the ſame <hi>proviſo</hi> as he ſaith he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively ſhew that he is able to make good, that all her former offices, Bailwicks and places ſhall be re-inveſted in her again.</p>
                  <p>The Lady ſeemed to approve of taking in all perſons, I will be caution that this man ſhall not break his word, but not ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip that he may not reckon without his hoſte, he will not come unleſs ſent for, all which I ſubmit to the Lady's better judgment, having Commiſſion to bring him thither whenever ſhe pleaſes to Command his attendance</p>

                  <p>TO anſwer yours then of the 15th. <hi>March</hi> both Latin and Engliſh, I preſume that e'er this you may have ſeen the <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> Attornys circular letter to his Companions, becauſe every Coffee-houſe has Copies of it, wherein he doth not only mention, a new Tryal, but alſo a new Jury, or elſe reſolveth flatly not to come up to the Aſſiſe.</p>
                  <p>But an intimate friend of his told me no longer agon than ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, that he is ſure nothing can be more remote from his heart, than a new Jury, and that he doth give out this only, <hi>Captare Benevolentiam</hi> with the Grand jury men, and <hi>John Bothoaks</hi> their Solicitour, becauſe ſayeth the craftie Pettifogger unto them, I move thus only for your ſakes, ſince whatever I deſire, the Judg will never grant, and ſo have dextrouſly avoyded a new Jury by ſeeming to demand one, which conſidering the humour of the mans dealing is not totally improbable.</p>
                  <p>Pray acquaint the Lady with this perticular, becauſe it is moſt true and worth her knowing.</p>
                  <p>I am very glad to hear it again confirmed by you, that the Gardeners brother proveth a good man, he ſaith right, the two Trees muſt down, which now there is no more diſpute cannot ſtand without the undermining of the Ladies houſe, but all the craft will be how to get them removed, for which the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Brothers Tools I doubt are not ſharp enough, beſides thoſe who have promiſed to work with him, when the Spade cometh to the Rock 'tis to be feared may digg Counter, for at preſent 'tis a tough piece of labour, and will continue ſo untill the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Siſter doth feel the inconvenience of their ſtanding there as well as ſhe herſelf has felt it already.</p>
                  <p>That the Lady has gotten a Plenipotentiary of her own chuſing is good, if he doth not find that he muſt digg againſt the Rock too, for then as well as I love the man, he is not to learn this leſſon of the Ladies, of any Church whatſoever, <hi>durum erit tibi contrà ſtimulum calcitare,</hi> my friend, I begin to hope may do well by ſomething I have heard of him, whereof more by the next return.</p>
                  <p>Send me word I entreat you what Bills are upon the Stocks, and whether there be one in hand to exclude the Catholick Lords
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:153668:56"/> from Sitting and Voting in the Houſe of Peers, that I may prepare accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Since the Prieſts and Monks are all gon, when they are beyond Seas again, more Maſters of their Conceptions than they were here, I pray God that they may write no fooliſh Books to inflame the reckoning, which by the way they are like enough to doe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs warned to the contrary by the Lady, whoſe good they ought to tender more then the pleaſing of their fancies, ſince the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their follies, otherwiſe will certainly light upon her in the concluſion of things.</p>
                  <p>Since the Lady will go to a new triall, intend, proceed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper and reign, the Gardener will not be long from you to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his word; but if the event doth not prove otherwiſe than is expected I am much couſened, for either <hi>John Bothoaks</hi> muſt heeds be ſtark mad, or he is ſure of having already packed the Cards enough to doe his feat with the Jury before he cometh to ſit down at <hi>primaviſti</hi> with the Lady, in fine, though I knew <hi>Caſſandra</hi> was an Aſſe for Prophecying always where ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believed, yet I cannot leave this kind of ſtyle for my heart.</p>
                  <p>Let your new Inſtruments be never ſo acceptable to the Jury for a while, that is to ſay, till the cheat be enacted, they will not have been long in the Ladies hands, but they will become like the others heretofore, whom they ſo much diſtaſted, ſince their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is not to accept of her ſecurity upon a change of officers, but right or wrong to reject it, whatever ſhe offers, or whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe imployeth.</p>
                  <p>Another ſcruple too I have, which is, whether her friend over the dyke will be true to her or no, for if ſo, as you well obſerve Orange Trees will not thrive in our ſoil, farewell till I ſee you.</p>

                  <p>In order then, Sir, to the plainneſs which I profeſs, I will tell you what has formerly paſs'd between your Reverend Predeceſſor Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> and my ſelf, about Three years ago, when the King my Maſter ſent a Troop of his Horſe Guards into his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie's Service, under the Command of my Lord <hi>Duras,</hi> he ſent with it an Officer call'd Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> with whom I had a particular intimacy, and who had then very newly embrac'd the Catholick Religion; to him did I conſtantly write, and by him addreſs my ſelf to Father <hi>Ferrier;</hi> The firſt thing of great Importance which I preſum'd to offer to him (not to trouble you with leſſer Matters, or what paſs'd here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and immediately after the fatal Revocation of the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, to which we owe all our late Miſeries and Hazards) was in <hi>July, Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi> 73. when I conſtantly inculcated the great danger Catholick Religion, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie's Intereſt would be in at our next Seſſions of Parliament, which was then to be in <hi>October</hi> following; at which, I plainly foreſaw that the King my Maſter would be forc'd to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in prejudice of his Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> which I ſaw ſo evidently and particularly that we ſhould make Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> that I urg'd all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I could (which to me were Demonſtrations) to convince your Court of that miſchief, and preſs'd what I could to perſuade his Chriſtian Majeſty to uſe his utmoſt force to prevent that Seſſions of our Parliament; and propos'd Expedients how to do it: but I was anſwer'd ſo often and ſo poſitively that his Chriſtian Majeſty was ſo well aſſur'd by his Ambaſ here, our Ambaſ. there, the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and even the King himſelf, that he had no ſuch apprehenſion at all, but was fully ſatisfied of the contrary, and look'd upon what I offer'd as a very Zealous miſtake, that I was forc'd to give over arguing, though not believing, as I did; but confidently appeal'd to time and ſucceſs, to prove who took their meaſures righteſt. When it hapned that what I foreſaw came to paſs, the Good Father was a little ſurpriz'd to ſee all the Great Men miſtaken, and a little one in the right, and was pleas'd by Sir <hi>W. Throckmorton</hi> to deſire the continuance of my Correſpondence, which I was mighty willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, knowing the Intereſts of our King, and in a more particular manner of my more immediate Maſter the Duke, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to be ſo inſeparably united, that it was impoſſible to divide them without deſtroying them all. Upon this I ſhew that our Parliament in the Circumſtances it was in, manag'd by the timerous Counſels of our Miniſters, who then govern'd,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153668:57"/> could never be uſeful either to <hi>England, France,</hi> or Catholick Religion; but that we ſhould as certainly be forc'd from our Neutrality at their next Meeting. as we had been from our active Alliance with <hi>France</hi> the laſt; that a Peace in the Circumſtances we were in was much more to be deſir'd than the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the War, and that the Diſſolution of our Parliament would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure a Peace; for that the Confederates did more depend upon the Power they had in our Parliament, than upon any thing elſe in the World, and were more encourag'd from thence to continue the War; ſo that if that were Diſſolv'd, their meaſures would be all broken, and they conſequently in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neceſſitated to a Peace.</p>
                  <p>The Good Father, minding this Diſcourſe ſomewhat more than the Court of <hi>France</hi> thought fit to do my former, urg'd it ſo home to the King, that his M. was pleas'd to give him order to ſignifie to his R. H. my Maſter, that his Ma. was fully ſatisfied of his R. H's good Intentions towards him, and that he eſteem'd both their Intereſts as but one and the ſame; That my Lord <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> and the Parliament were both to be look'd upon as very unuſeful to their Intereſts, and that if his R. H. would endeavour to Diſſolve this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Ma. would aſſiſt him with his Power and Purſe to have ſuch a New one as ſhould be for their purpoſe: This and a great many more Expreſſions of Kindneſs and Confidence Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> was pleas'd to communicate to Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> and commanded him to ſend them to his R. H. and withal to beg his R. H. to propoſe to his moſt Chriſtian M. what he thought neceſſary for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and the advantage of Religion, and his M. would certainly do all he could to advance both or either of them; this Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> ſent to me by an Expreſs who left <hi>Paris</hi> on the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1674. <hi>S. N.</hi> I no ſooner had it, but I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated it to his R. H. to which his R. H. commanded me to anſwer as I did on the 29<hi>th</hi> of the ſame Month.</p>
                  <p>That his R. H. was very ſenſible of his moſt Chriſtian M's Friendſhip, and that he would labour to cultivate it with all the good Offices he was capable of doing for his Ma. That he was fully convinc'd that their Intereſts were both one. That my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament were not only unuſeful, but very dangerous both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> that therefore it was neceſſary that they ſhould do all they could to Diſſolve it; and, That his R. H's opinion was, that if his moſt Chriſtian M. would write his Thoughts freely to the King of <hi>England</hi> upon this Subject, and make the ſame offer to his M. of his Purſe to Diſſolve this, which he had made to his R. H. to call another, he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it very poſſible for him to ſucceed, with the aſſiſtance we ſhould be able to give him here, and that if this Parliament were Diſſolv'd, there would be no great difficulty of getting a new One which would be more uſeful, the Conſtitution of our Parliaments being ſuch, that a new One can never hurt the Crown, nor an old One do it good.</p>
                  <p>His R. H. being pleas'd to own theſe Propoſitions, which were but only General; I thought it reaſonable to be more particular, and come cloſer to the Point.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That if we hapned to agree,</hi> we might go the faſter about the work, and come to ſome Iſſue before the time were too much ſpent: I laid this for my Maxim, <hi>The Diſſolution of our Parliament will certainly procure a Peace;</hi> which Propoſition was granted by every body I convers'd withal, even by Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> himſelf, with whom I took liberty of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo far; but durſt not ſay any thing of the Intelligence I had with Father <hi>Ferrier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:153668:57"/>
                  <p>Next, <hi>That a Sum of Money certain, would vertainly procure a Diſſolution:</hi> This ſome doubted, but I am ſure I never did; for I knew perfectly well that the King had frequent Diſputes with himſelf at that time, whether he ſhould diſſolve or continue them, and he ſeveral times declar'd, that the Arguments were ſo ſtrong on both ſides, that he could not tell to which to incline; but was carried at laſt to the continuance of them by this one Argument; If I try them once more they may poſſibly give me Money, if they do, I have gain'd my Point; if they do not, I can diſſolve them then, and be where I am now; ſo that I have a poſſibility at leaſt of getting Money for their continuance, againſt nothing of the other ſide. But if we could have turn'd this Argument, and ſaid, Sir, Their Diſſolution will certainly procure you Money, when you have only a bare poſſibility of getting any by their continuance, and have ſhown how far that bare poſſibility was from being a Foundation to build any reaſonable hope upon, which I am ſure His Majeſty was ſenſible <hi>enough</hi> of; and how much 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling certain (which was the Sum we propoſed) was better than a bare poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (without any reaſon to hope that that would ever be compaſs'd) of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half ſo much more (which was the moſt he deſign'd to ask) upon ſome vile diſhonourable terms, and a 1000 other hazards which we had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be afraid of; If I ſay we had had Power to have argued thus, I am moſt confidently aſſur'd we could have compaſs'd it; for Logick in our Court built upon Money, has more powerful Charms than any other ſort of reaſoning: But to ſecure his moſt Chriſtian M. from any hazard as to this point, I propos'd that his M. ſhould offer that Sum upon that Condition, and if that Condition were not perform'd, the Money ſhould ne'r be due; if it were, and that a Peace would certainly follow thereupon (which no body doubted) his Majeſty would gain his ends, and ſave all the vaſt Expences of the next Campagn, by which he could not hope to better his Condition, or to put himſelf into more advantageous Circumſtances of Treating than he was then in, but might very probably be in a much worſe, conſidering the mighty Oppoſitions he was like to meet with, and the uncertain Chances of War; but admitting that His Majeſty could Maintain himſelf by his great Strength and Conduct in as good a Condition to Treat the next year as he was then in, which was as much as could then reaſonably be hop'd for, he ſhould have ſav'd by this Propoſal, as much as all the Men he muſt needs loſe, and all the Charges he ſhould be at in a year could be valued to amount to more than 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling; &amp; ſo much more, in caſe his Condition ſhould decay, as it ſhould be worſe than it was when this was made: <hi>and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of H. R. H. and of Cath. Religion here, which depends very much upon the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his M. C. M.</hi> deliver'd from a great many frights and real hazards. Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> ſeem'd to be very ſenſible of the benefit which all Parties would gain by this Propoſal; but yet it was unfortunately delay'd by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and tedious Sickneſs which kept him ſo long from the King in <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> and made him ſo unable to wait upon his Ma. after he did return to <hi>Paris;</hi> but ſo ſoon as he could compaſs it, he was pleas'd to acquaint his Ma. with it, and did write to the Duke himſelf, and did me the honour to write alſo to me on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 74 and ſent his Letters by Sir <hi>Will. Throck-morton,</hi> who came Expreſs upon that Errand. In theſe Letters he gave his R. H. freſh aſſurances of his M. C. M's. friendſhip, and of his Zeal and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to comply with every thing his R. H had, or ſhould think fit to propoſe in favour of Religion, or the Buſineſs of the Money; and that he had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> as to the latter, to Treat and deal with his R. H. and to receive and obſerve his Orders and Directions, but deſir'd that he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153668:58"/> might not be all concern'd as to the former; but that his R. H. would cauſe what Propoſitions he ſhould think fit to be made about Religion, to be offer'd either to Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> or Monſieur <hi>Pompone.</hi> Theſe Letters came to us about the middle of our <hi>September,</hi> and his R. H. expected daily when Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> ſhould ſpeak to him about the ſubject of that Letter, but he took no notice at all of any thing till the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> the Evening before the King and Duke went to <hi>New-Market</hi> for a Fortnight, and then only ſaid, That he had Command from his Maſter to give his R. H. the moſt firm aſſurances imaginable of his Friendſhip, or ſomething to that purpoſe, making his R. H. a general Compliment, but made no mention of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Orders relating to the Subject of Fa. <hi>Ferrier</hi>'s Letter: The Duke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at this proceeding, and being oblig'd to ſtay good part of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>New-Market,</hi> and ſoon after his coming back, hearing of the Death of Fa. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> he gave over all farther proſecuting of the former Project.</p>
                  <p>But I believ'd I ſaw Monſieur <hi>de Rouvigny</hi>'s Policy all along, who was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſave his Maſter's Money, upon an aſſurance that we would do all we could to ſtave off the Parliament for our own ſakes, that we would ſtruggle as hard without Money as with it, <hi>and we having by this time upon our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts prevail'd to</hi> get the Parliament Prorogu'd till the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> he thought that Prorogation, being to a Day ſo high in the Spring, would put the Confederates ſo much beyond their meaſures, as that it might procure a Peace, and be as uſeful to <hi>France</hi> as a Diſſolution. Upon theſe reaſons, which I ſuppos'd he went upon, I had ſeveral diſcourſes with him, and did open my ſelf to him ſo far, as to ſay, That I could wiſh his Maſter would give us leave to offer 300000 <hi>l.</hi> to our Maſter for the Diſſolution of the Parliament, and ſhew him that a Peace would moſt certainly follow a Diſſolution, which he agreed with me in; and that we deſir'd not the Money from his Maſter to excite our wills, or to make us more induſtrious to uſe our utmoſt powers to procure a Diſſolution, but to ſtrengthen our Power and Credit with the King, and to render us more capable to ſucceed with his Ma. as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we ſhould have done had we been fortified with ſuch an Argument. To this purpoſe I preſs'd Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> frequently by Sir <hi>W. Throck.</hi> who return'd from hence again into <hi>France</hi> on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> the Day our Parliament ſhould have ſat, but was Prorogu'd, Monſieur <hi>Pompone,</hi> as I was inform'd by Sir <hi>Will.</hi> did ſeem to approve the thing; but yet had two Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt it: Firſt, That the Sum we propos'd was great, and could very ill be ſpar'd by his Maſter in the Circumſtances he was in. To which we anſwer'd, That if by his expending this Sum he could procure a Diſſolution of our Parliament, and thereby a Peace, which every body agreed would neceſſarily follow, his M. C. M. would ſave 5 or 10 times a greater Sum, and ſo be a good Husband by his Expence; and if we did not procure a Diſſolution, he ſhould not be at that Expence at all; for that we deſir'd him only to Promiſe upon that Condition, which we were content to be oblig'd to perform firſt. The ſecond Objection was, That the Duke did not move it, nor appear in it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: To that we anſwer'd, That he did not indeed to Monſieur <hi>Pompone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had found ſo ill an effect of the Negotiation with Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> when it came into Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi>'s hands; but he had concerned himſelf in it to Fa. <hi>Ferrier;</hi> yet I continued to proſecute and preſs the Diſſolution of the Parliament, deteſting all Prorogations, as only ſo much loſs of time, and a means of ſtrengthning all thoſe who depended upon it in oppoſition to the Crown, the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> and Cath. Religion, in the Opinion they had taken that our King durſt not part with this Parliament, apprehending another would be much worſe. 2. That he could not live long without a Parliament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153668:58"/> they muſt ſuddenly meet; and the longer he kept them off, the greater his Neceſſities would grow, and conſequently their Power to compel him to do what they liſted would encreaſe accordingly; and therefore if they could but maintain themſelves a while, their Day would certainly come in a ſhort time, in which they ſhould be able to work their wills; Such Diſcourſes as theſe kept the Confederates and our Malecontents in heart, and made them weather on the War in ſpite of all our Prorogations; and therefore I preſs'd, as I have ſaid, a Diſſolution, until <hi>February</hi> laſt; when our Circumſtances were ſo totally chang'd, that we were forc'd to change our Counſels too, and be as much for the Parliaments ſitting, as we were before againſt it. Our change was thus, Before that time, the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was the only Miniſter in Credit, who thought himſelf out of all Danger of the Parliament, he having been accus'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and juſtified, and therefore was zealouſly for their Sitting; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Reputation with them, and to become a perfect Favourite, he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all he could to perſecute Cath. Religion, and to oppoſe the <hi>French;</hi> to ſhew his Zeal againſt the firſt, he reviv'd ſome old Dormant Orders for Prohibiting Ro. Cath. to appear before the King, and put them into Execution at his firſt coming into his Office of Lord Chamberlain; and to make ſure work againſt the ſecond as he thought; prevail'd with the King to give him and the Earl of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> who Married two Siſters of <hi>Men, Heer Dyke,</hi> leave to go over into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Heeren,</hi> to make a Viſit, as they pretended, to their Relations; but indeed and in truth to propoſe the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to his R. H. as a Match for the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> not only without the conſent, but againſt the good liking of his R. H. inſomuch that the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>'s Creatures were forc'd to excuſe him with a diſtinction, that the ſaid Lady was not to be look'd upon as the Duke's Daughter, by as the Kings, and a Child of the State, and ſo the Duke's conſent not to be much conſider'd in the diſpoſal of her, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt only of State; but this he intended to render himſelf the Darling of the Parliament and Proteſtants, who would look upon themſelves as ſecur'd in their Religion by ſuch an Alliance, and deſign'd farther by that means to draw us into cloſe Conjunction with <hi>Holland</hi> and the Enemies of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> ſet forth upon this Errand on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 74. and return'd not till the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following; during his abſence, the Lord Treaſurer, the Lord Keeper, and Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who were the only Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in any conſiderable Credit with the King, and who all pretended to be intirely united to the Duke, declaim'd loudly and with great violence againſt the ſaid Lord, and his Actions in <hi>Holland,</hi> and did hope in his abſence to have totally ſupplanted him, and rooted him out of the King's Favour, and after that they thought they might eaſily enough have dealt with the Parliament; but none of them had courage enough to ſpeak againſt the Parliament till they could get rid of him, for fear they ſhould not ſucceed; but that the Parliament would ſit in ſpite of them, and come to hear that they had us'd their endeavours againſt it; which would have been ſo unpardonable a Crime with our Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Parliament, that no Power would have been able to have ſav'd them from Puniſhment; but they finding at his return that they could not prevail againſt him by ſuch Means and Arts as they had then tryed, reſolv'd upon new Counſels, which were to out-run him in his own courſe, which accordingly they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and became as fierce Apoſtles and as Zealous for Proteſtant Religion, againſt Popery, as ever my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was before them, and in purſuance thereof, perſuaded the King to iſſue out thoſe ſevere Orders and Proclamations againſt Catholicks, which came out in <hi>Febr.</hi> laſt; by which they did as much as in them lay to Extirpate all Catholicks and Catholick Religion out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which Counſels were in my poor Opinion ſo deteſtable, being levell'd, as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:153668:59"/> they muſt needs be, ſo directly againſt the Duke, by People which he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and who had profeſs'd ſo much Duty and Service to him that we were put upon new thoughts how to ſave his R. H. now from the deceits and ſnares of them upon whom we formerly depended; we ſaw well enough that their deſign was to make themſelves as grateful as they could to the Parliament, if it muſt ſit, they thinking nothing to be ſo acceptable to them as the Perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Popery; but yet they were ſo obnoxious to the Parliament's Diſpleaſure in general, that they would have been very glad of any Expedient to have kept it off, though they durſt not engage againſt it openly themſelves; but thought this Device of theirs might ſerve for that purpoſe, hoping that the Duke would be ſo alarm'd at this proceeding, and by his being left by every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he would be much more afraid of the Parliament than ever, and would uſe his utmoſt power to prevent its ſitting, which they doubted not but he would endeavour, and they were ready enough to work underhand with him for their own ſakes not his, in order thereunto, but durſt not appear openly; to encourage the Duke the more to endeavour to Diſſolve the Parliament, their Creatures us'd to ſay up and down, That this rigorous proceeding againſt Cath. was in favour of the Duke, and to make the Diſſolution of the Parliament more eaſie, which they knew he coveted, by obviating one great Objection which was commonly made againſt it; which was, That if the Parliament ſhould be Diſſolv'd, it would be ſaid that it was done in favour of Popery, which cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour they had prevented by the ſeverity which they had ſhown againſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we ſaw theſe Tricks put upon us, we plainly ſaw what Men we had to deal with, and what we had to truſt to if we were wholly at their mercy, but yet durſt not ſeem ſo diſſatisfied as we really were, but rather magnified the Contrivance as a Device of great Cunning and Skill; all this we did purely to hold them on in a belief, that we would endeavour to Diſſolve the Parliament, that they might rely upon his R. H. for that, which we knew they long'd for, and were afraid they might do ſome other way if they diſcover'd that we were reſolv'd we would not: At length when we ſaw the Seſſions ſecur'd, we declar'd we were for the Parliaments meeting, as indeed we were from the moment we ſaw our ſelves us'd by all the King's Miniſters at ſuch a rate, that we had reaſon to believe they would Sacrifice <hi>France,</hi> Religion, and his R. H. too to their own Intereſt if occaſion ſerv'd, and that they were led to believe, that that was the only way they had to ſave themſelves at that time: for we ſaw no expedient fit to ſtop them in their career of Perſecution, and thoſe other deſtructive Counſels but the Parliament, which had ſet it ſelf a long time to diſlike every thing the Miniſters had done, and had appear'd violently againſt Popery, whilſt the Court ſeem'd to favour it, and therefore we were confident that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters having turn'd their faces, the Parliament would do ſo too, and ſtill be againſt them, and be as little for Perſecution then as they had been for Popery before; this I undertook to manage for the Duke and the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and aſſur'd Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> (which I am ſure he will teſtifie if occaſion ſerves) that that Seſſions ſhould do neither of them any hurt; for that I was ſure I had Power enough to prevent miſchief, though I durſt not anſwer for any good they ſhould do, becauſe I had but very few Aſſiſtants to carry on the work, and wanted thoſe helps which others had of making Friends: The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſpared no pains, nor expence of Money, to animate as many as they could againſt <hi>France;</hi> our Lord Treaſurer, Lord Keeper, all the Biſhops, and ſuch as call themſelves old Cavaliers, who were all then as one man, were not leſs induſtrious againſt Popery, and had the Purſe at their Girdle too, which is an excellent Inſtrument to gain Friends with; and all united againſt the Duke as Patron both of <hi>France</hi> and Cath. Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:153668:59"/>
                  <p>To deal with all this force, we had no Money but what came from a few private hands, and thoſe ſo mean ones too, that I dare venture to ſay, that I ſpent more my particular ſelf out of my own Fortune, and upon my ſingle Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, than all the whole body of Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> beſides, which was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in Compariſon of what our Adverſaries could command, and we verily believe did beſtow in making their Party, that it is not worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet notwithſtanding all this, we ſaw that by the help of the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, (as <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other Sects, who were as much afraid of Perſecution as our ſelves) and of the Enemies of the Miniſters, and particularly of the Treaſurer (who by that time had ſupplanted the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> and was grown ſole Menager of all Affairs himſelf) we ſhould be able to prevent what they deſign'd againſt us, and ſo render the Seſſions ineffectual to their ends, though we might not be able to compaſs our own; which were to make ſome brisk ſtep in favour of his R. H. to ſhow the King that his Ma's Affairs in Parliament were not obſtructed by reaſon of any averſion they had to his R. H's Perſon, or apprehenſion they had of him or his Religion; but from Faction and Ambition in ſome, and from a real Diſſatisfaction in others, that we have not had ſuch fruits and effects of thoſe great Sums of Money which have formerly been given, as they expected: If we could have made then but one ſuch ſtep, the King vvould certainly have reſtor'd his R. H. to all his Commiſſions, upon which he would have been much greater than ever yet he was in his whole life, or could probably ever have been by any other courſe in the world than what he had taken of becoming Catholick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we were ſo very near gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Point, that I did humbly beg his R. H. to give me leave to put the Parliament upon making an Addreſs to the King, that His Ma. would be pleas'd to put the Fleet into the hands of H. R. H. as the only Perſon likely to give a good account of ſo important a Charge as that was to the Kingdom; and ſhew his R. H. ſuch reaſons to perſuade him that we could carry it. That he agreed with me in it that he believ'd we could; yet others telling him how great a dammage it would be to him if he ſhould miſs in ſuch an undertaking (which for my part I could not then ſee nor do as yet) he was prevail'd upon not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though he was perſuaded he could carry it. I did communicate this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of mine to Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny,</hi> who agreed with me that it would be the greateſt advantage to his Maſter imaginable, to have the Duke's Power and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſo advanc'd as this would certainly do it if we could compaſs it, I ſhew'd him all the difficulties we were like to meet with, and what helps we ſhould have, but that we ſhould want one very material one, <hi>Money,</hi> to carry on the work as we ought; and therefore I do confeſs I did ſhamefully beg his Maſter's help, and would willingly have been content to have been in everlaſting Diſgrace with all the world, if I had not with the aſſiſtance of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling from him (which perhaps is not the Tenth part of what was ſpent on t'other ſide) made it evident to the Duke that he could not have miſs'd it: Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> us'd to tell me, That if he could be ſure of ſucceeding in that deſign his Maſter would give a very much larger Sum; but that he was not in a condition to throw away Money upon uncertainties; I anſwer'd, that nothing of this Nature can be ſo infallibly ſure as not to be ſubject to ſome poſſibility of failing; but that I durſt venture to undertake to make it evident, that there was as great an aſſurance of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in it, as any Husbandman can have of a Crop in Harveſt, who ſows his Ground in its Seaſon; and yet it would be accounted a very Imprudent piece of warineſs in any body to ſcruple the venturing ſo much Seed in its proper time; becauſe it is poſſible it may be totally loſt, and no benefit found of it in Harveſt. He that minds the Winds and the Rains at that rate, ſhall neither ſow nor reap.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:153668:60"/>
                  <p>I take our caſe to be much the ſame now, as it was the laſt Seſſions, if we can advance the Duke's Intereſt one ſtep forward, we ſhall put him out of the reach of all Chances for ever; for he makes ſuch a Figure already, that cautious Men do not care to act againſt him, or always without him; becauſe they do not ſee that he is much out-power'd by his Enemies, yet is he not at ſuch a pitch as to be quite out of Danger, or free from Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but if he could gain any conſiderable new Addition of Power, all would come over to him as the only ſteddy Center of our Government, and no body would contend with him farther; then would Catholicks be at caſe, and his M. C. M's Intereſt ſecur'd with us in <hi>England,</hi> beyond all Apprehenſions whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, we have two great Deſigns to attempt the next Seſſions: 1. That which we were about before, <hi>viz.</hi> To put the Parliament upon making it their humble Requeſt to the King, That the Fleet may be put into his R. H's Care. And, 2. To get an Act for General Liberty of Conſcience. If we carry theſe two, or either of them, we ſhall in effect do what we liſt afterwards; and truly we think we do not undertake theſe great Points very unreaſonably, but that we have good Cards for our Game; not but that we expect great Oppoſition, and have reaſon to beg all the Aſſiſtance we can poſſibly get; and therefore if his M. C. M. would ſtand by us a little in this Conjuncture, and help us with ſuch a Sum as 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, (which is no very great matter to venture upon ſuch an undertaking as this) I would be content to be Sacrific'd to the utmoſt Malice of my Enemies if I did not ſucceed; I have propos'd this ſeveral times to Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny,</hi> who ſeems always of my Opinion, and has often told me that he has writ into <hi>France</hi> upon this Subject, and has deſir'd me to do the like, but I know not whether he will be as Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in this Point as a Catholick would be; becauſe our prevailing in theſe things will give the greateſt Blow to the Proteſtant Religion here, that ever it receiv'd ſince its Birth, which perhaps he would not be very glad to ſee, eſpecially when he believes that there is another way of doing his Maſter's Buſineſs well enough without it, which is by a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Parliament, upon which I know he mightily depends, and concludes, That if that comes to be Diſſolv'd, it will be as much as he need care for, proceeding perhaps upon the ſame manner of Diſcourſe which we did this time Twelve months; But with ſubmiſſion to his better Judgment, I do think that our caſe is extremely much alter'd from what it was then in relation to a Diſſolution; for then the Body of our Governing Miniſters, all but the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> were entirely united to the Duke, and would have govern'd his way if they had been free from all fear and controul, as they would have been if the Parliament had been remov'd: But they having ſince that time engag'd in quite different Counſels, and Embark'd themſelves and Intereſts upon other Bottoms, having declar'd themſelves againſt Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Diſſolve the Parliament ſimply, and without any other ſtep made, will be to leave them to govern what way they liſt, which we have reaſon to ſuſpect will be to the prejudice of <hi>France</hi> and Catholicks, becauſe their late Declarations and Actions have demonſtrated to us, that they take that for the moſt Popular way for themſelves, and the likelieſt to keep them in Abſolute Power; whereas ſhould the Duke get above them after the Tricks they have ſerv'd him, they are not ſure he will totally forget the uſage he has had at their hands. Therefore it imports us now to advance our Intereſt a little farther by ſome ſuch Project as I have nam'd, before we Diſſolve the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or elſe perhaps we ſhall but change Maſters, a Parliament for Miniſters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill in the ſame Slavery and Bondage as before; But one ſuch ſtep as I have propos'd being well made, we may ſafely ſee them Diſſolv'd, and not fear the Miniſters, but ſhall be eſtabliſh'd and ſtand firm without any Oppoſition; for every body will then come over to us, and worſhip the Riſing Sun.</p>
                  <p>I have here given you the Hiſtory of Three Years, as ſhort as I could, though I am afraid it will ſeem very long and troubleſom to your R. among the Multitude of the Affairs you are engag'd in; I have alſo ſhewn you the preſent State of our Caſe, which may by God's Providence and good Conduct, be made of ſuch Advantage to God's Church, that for my part I can ſcarce believe my ſelf awake, or the thing real, when I think of a Prince, in ſuch an Age as we live in, converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal and Piety as not to regard any thing in the World in compariſon of God Almighty's Glory, the Salvation of his own Soul, and the Converſion of our poor Kingdom, which has a long time been oppreſs'd and miſerably haraſs'd by Hereſie and Schiſm. I doubt not but your R. will conſider our caſe and take it to heart, and afford us what help you can, both with the King of Heaven by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayers, and with his M. C. M. by that great Credit which you moſt juſtly have with him; and if ever his Ma's Affairs, or your own, can ever want the Service of ſo inconſiderable a Creature as my ſelf, you ſhall never find any body readier to obey your Commands, or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller in the execution of them to the beſt of his Power, than</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Sent your Reverence a tedious long Letter, on our 29th of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to inform you of the progreſs of Affairs, for theſe two or three years laſt paſt, I having now again the opportunity of a very ſure hand to convey this by, I have ſent you a Cypher, becauſe our Parliament now drawing on, I may poſſibly have occaſion to ſend you ſomething which you may be willing enough to know, and may be neceſſary for us that you ſhould, when we may want the conveniency of a Meſſenger. When any thing occurs of more Concern, other than which may not be fit to be truſted, even to a Cypher alone, I will, to make ſuch a thing more ſecure, write in Lemmon between the Lines of a Letter, which ſhall have nothing in it viſible, but what I care not who ſees, but dried by a warm fire, ſhall diſcover what is written; ſo that if the Letter comes to your hands, and upon drying it, any thing appears more han did before, you may be ſure no body has ſeen it by the way. I will not trouble you with that way of writing, but upon ſpecial occaſions, and then I will give you a hint to direct you to look for it, by concluding my viſible Letter with ſomething of Fire, or burning, by which mark you may pleaſe to know, that there is ſomething underneath, and how my Letter is to be uſed to find it out. <hi>We have here a mighty Work
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153668:61"/> upon our hands, no leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and by that perhaps the ſubduing of a Peſtilent Hereſie, which has domineered over great part of this Northern World a long time, there were never ſuch hopes of Succeſs ſince the Death of Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>as now in our dayes:</hi> When God has given us a Prince who is become (may I ſay, a Miracle) zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of being the Author and Inſtrument of ſo glorious a Work; but the oppoſition we are ſure to meet with, is alſo like to be great: ſo that it imports us to get all the Aid and Aſſiſtance we can, for <hi>the Harveſt is great, and the Labourers but few.</hi> That which we rely upon moſt, next to God Almighty's Providence, and the favour of my Maſter, the Duke, is the mighty Mind of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Soul inclines him to great Undertakings, which being managed by your Reverence's exemplary Piety and Prudence, will certainly make him look upon this as moſt ſutable to himſelf, and beſt becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Power and Thoughts; ſo that I hope you will pardon me if I be very troubleſome to you upon this occaſion, from whom I expect the greateſt help we can hope for. I muſt confeſs, I think his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Temporal Intereſt is ſo much attracted to that of his <hi>R. H.</hi> (which can never be conſiderable, but upon the growth and Advancement of the Catholick Religion) that his Miniſters cannot give him better Advice, even in a Politick ſenſe, abſtracting from the Conſiderations of the next World, that of our bleſſed Lord, to ſeek firſt the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> that <hi>all other things</hi> may be <hi>added unto</hi> him. That I know his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has more powerful Motives ſuggeſted to him by his own Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your Reverence's Zeal for God's Glory, to engage him to afford us the beſt help he can in our preſent Circumſtances. But we are a little unhappy in this, that we cannot preſs his Majeſty, by his preſent Miniſter here, upon theſe latter Arguments (which are moſt ſtrong) but onely upon the firſt, Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi>'s Senſe and ours differing very much upon them, though we agree perfectly upon the reſt: And indeed, though he be a very able man, as to his Maſter's Service, in things wherein Religion is not concerned; yet I believe it were much more happy (conſidering the poſture he is now in) that his temper were of ſuch a ſort, that we might deal clearly with him throughout, and not be forc'd to ſtep ſhort in a Diſcourſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and leave the moſt material part out, becauſe we know it will ſhock his particular opinion, and ſo perhaps meet with Diſlike and Oppoſition, though never ſo neceſſary to the main Concern. I am afraid we ſhall find too much reaſon for this Complaint in this next Seſſion of Parliament: for, had we had one here from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, who had taken the whole Buſineſs to heart, and who would have repreſented the ſtate of our caſe truly, as it is to his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153668:61"/> Maſter, I do not doubt but his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf further in the Affair than at preſent I fear he has done, and by his Approbation have given ſuch Counſels as have been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Royal Highneſs by thoſe few Catholicks who have acceſs to him, and who are bent to ſerve him, and advance the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with all their Might, and might have more Credit with his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs than I fear they have found, and have aſſiſted them alſo with his Purſe, as far as 10000 Crowns, or ſome ſuch Sum, (which to him is very inconſiderable, but would have been to them of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Uſe than can be imagined) towards gaining others to help them, or, at leaſt, not to oppoſe them. If we had been ſo happy as to have had his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty with us to this degree, I would have anſwered with my Life for ſuch Succeſs this Seſſions, as would have put the Intereſt of the Catholick Religion, his R. Highneſs, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, out of all danger for the time to come; but wanting thoſe helps of recommending thoſe neceſſary Counſels which have been given his <hi>R. H.</hi> in ſuch manner as to make him think them worth his accepting, and fit to govern himſelf by, and of thoſe Advantages which a little Money well managed would have gained us, I am afraid we ſhall not be much better at the end of this Seſſions, than we are now: I pray God we do not loſe ground; by my next, which will be e're long, I ſhall be able to tell your Reverence more particularly what we are like to expect; in the mean time, I moſt humbly beg your holy Prayers for all our Undertakings, and that you will be pleaſed to honour me ſo far as to eſteem me what I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and without reſerve,</p>

                     <hi>Coleman's</hi> Letter to Monſieur <hi>le Cheſe,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King<hi>'s</hi> Confeſſor, in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s name.</head>
                  <p>ON the Second of <hi>June</hi> laſt, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty offered me very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly his Friendſhip, and his Purſe too, for my aſſiſtance againſt the Deſigns of my Enemies and his, and proteſted to me, that his Intereſts and mine were ſo ſtrictly bound up together, that ſuch as oppoſed either, ought to be look'd upon as the Enemies of the other; and told me beſides his thoughts of my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and of the Parliament, which are, that he doth not believe that either the one or the other were favourable to his Intereſts, or to mine, and thereupon he deſired me to make him ſuch Propoſitions as I ſhould think
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153668:62"/> ſit for this Conjuncture. All this happened by the Interpoſition of <hi>F. Ferrier,</hi> who made uſe of Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> a good and honeſt man, who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> and has correſponded with <hi>Coleman,</hi> one of my Domeſticks, in whom I put great confidence.</p>
                  <p>As I was very well ſatisfied to ſee that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of my opinion, I returned him an Anſwer on the twenty ninth of <hi>June,</hi> by the ſame conveyance by which he writ me, that is, by <hi>Coleman,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it to <hi>F. Ferrier,</hi> by the ſaid Sir <hi>William Throckmorton;</hi> and I agreed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with him, as well concerning the Union of our Intereſts, as how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs my Lord <hi>A.</hi> and the Parliament were to the King, my Brother, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that it was very neceſſary for us to make uſe of all our Credit joyntly, for preventing the Succeſs of the evil Deſigns that my Lord <hi>Ar.</hi> and the Parliamentarians have formed againſt his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and me, which I promiſed to do faithfully, on my part, and whereof I have given ſince that time ſufficient teſtimonies; after this, I made ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that I thought fit for the accompliſhment of what we were oblig'd to undertake, aſſuring him, that nothing could ſupport our Intereſts ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the King, my Brother, than the making him the ſame Offers of his Purſe, by the aſſiſtance whereof, I had great reaſon to hope, that I ſhould be capable of perſwading him to diſſolve the Parliament, and of fruſtrating the Intrigues of my Lord <hi>Ar.</hi> who endeavours continually to advance the Credit of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to diminiſh that of the King, your Maſter, notwithſtanding all the Proteſtations he now makes to ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>But as our Propoſitions were delay'd by the ſickneſs of <hi>F. Ferr.</hi> our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did not ſucceed according to our deſire, onely the Father writ me word on the fifteenth of the laſt Month, that he had communicated the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I directed to him from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that they were very acceptable unto him; but as they contained two things, one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Catholick Religion, and the other the offer of his Purſe, he gave me to underſtand, that he did not deſire I ſhould treat with Monſieur <hi>Rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igny</hi> upon the former; but for the latter, he told me at the ſame time, that <hi>Monſieur Rovigny</hi> had order to concur with me in all that the Conjuncture of Our Affairs ſhould make appear neceſſary. I have expected the Effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of until this time, but nothing being done, and perceiving beſides, that my Lord <hi>Ar.</hi> and many others endeavour, by a thouſand Tricks, to break off the good Underſtanding that is between the King my Brother, his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty, and me, for the deceiving of all Three; I have thought fit to acquaint you with all that is paſt, and to ask your Aſſiſtance and Friendſhip for preventing the Knavery of all thoſe that have no other Deſign than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Concerns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> too, and by their pretended Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, occaſion their Diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>I do refer you farther to Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> and to <hi>Coleman,</hi> whom I have commanded to acquaint you with the particulars of our Affairs, and the true State of <hi>England,</hi> that many others, and principally my Lord <hi>Ar.</hi> endeavoured to repreſent to you quite otherwiſe than it is; and theſe two firſt are very much addicted to my Intereſts, ſo that you may treat with them freely, and without any apprehenſion.</p>

                  <p>IT is certain, that the beſt way to render himſelf Maſter of the Kings Will, and to take him off from the Amity with the Parliament, is that of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and I doubt not but the Duke may by it make himſelf abſolute upon his ſpirit, and take for his pureſt and for that of the Catholicks the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which you obſerve in your laſt Letter, but when the Pope himſelf ſhall have the means to do that which ſhall be neceſſary in his Affair, which is very much beyond his power, for the reaſons I gave when I had the happineſs to ſee you, and of which I advertiſed you in many Letters, he can never be preſſed with Reaſon to do it, but upon more ſolid foundations, and more probable aſſurances for the good of Religion and of the Catholicks, which are not yet ſuch, as are contained in the diſcourſe mentioned in your laſt Letter, that which you propoſe touching 51666279669961 which is, 667177576661676676 cannot be put in execution 566662516 756665667 but with the 777699916699616797669961 of all 51679177 66629664996719 and onely 667191776691 compriſing 966699915167 91947151416791 you may then conſider, if in the Lands where they are at preſent 5167916654566646267919680204.
